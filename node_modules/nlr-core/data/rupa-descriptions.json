  "My most worshipable golden Lord Gauranga is joyfully surrounded by His most loving devotees in Shrivasa Pandita's courtyard at night. There He immerses Himself in the transcendental ocean of congregationally chanting His own holy names (internally absorbed in the divine rasa-dance of Shri Shri Radha and Krishna). He also dances wildly in a state of tearful shivering and over-whelming jubilation. After singing and dancing to His heart's content, He goes to a quiet flower-garden and enjoys a feast of forest fruits, served to Him as He reclines upon a jeweled bedstead. Thus, the Son of Shachi Devi is most deserving of my whole-hearted selfless worship.",
  "My dear mind! Just worship Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu who, at the end of the night, suddenly awakens upon hearing the sweet warbling of the birds within the delightfully flowering forest grove of Shrivasa Pandit! At this time, His whole body is intensely thrilled due to His being aware of Lord Krishna being situated very close to Shrimati Radhrarani on Their flower-bed in a bower-house in Vrindavan. Because of this Lord Gauranga's ecstatic love is expressed instantly by wonderfully transcendental symptoms such a fountains of tears gushing from His eyes, which bathe His entire body. Just worship this Lord Gauranga, Whose bodily complexion can only be compared to shimmering pure molten gold.",
  "After sunrise, Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu washes His moon-like face and comes out into the courtyard, where He sits and speaks lovingly from the heart with extreme eagerness and at great length to His most beloved devotees about Lord Kesava's morning pastimes at Nanda-gram. While speaking He tastes with great relish the ecstatic mood of Radharani, which causes His entire body to fully blossom in transcendental jubilation. Dear mind, just perform your worship with boundless, unending pure love for this golden Lord Gauranga.",
  "I worship the moon-like Shrila Gaurangachandra Who, among His closest devotees, remembers Krishnas forenoon pastimes of leaving for the forest to tend His cows. During this period, all the residents of Vraja come out and become greatly anxious due to Krishnas departure from their midst. Lord Gauranga is so absorbed in this intense remembrance that He virtually becomes fused with the Vraja pastimes. Thus He imitates their statements and actions, also bestowing their mood amongst His Navadvipa devotees, who are in reality alternate manifestations of those self-same residents of Vraja.",
  "Oh my dear mind! Continuously worship the Son of Mother Shachi Lord Gauranga! His whole body erupts in ecstatic bumps of sheer delight when He remembers the extensively variegated midday pastimes of Krishna sporting with Radha and the multitude of gopis. His voice stutters and chokes in excitement as He describes these lilas among His devotees, and thus He manifests the performance of plays and dramas which simultaneously correspond to the occurrence of the Divine Couple's pastimes.",
  "Lord Gauranga remembers the son of the King of Vraja, who returns from the pasture grounds in the noon, an event which produces an unlimited ocean of bliss for all the residents of Vraja. Remembering within the core of His heart, Lord Gauranga dances throughout the town of Navadvipa, spinning around while exhaling deeply ecstatic sighs. Thus becoming completely enchanted, He enchantes the townspeople so much that they all become helplessly stunned in divine love. Oh my dear mind, just worship this Shri Gauranga!",
  "Then Krishna takes His evening bath, has His dinner and performs many other fascinating pastimes around sunset time, then Lord Gauranga absorbs Himself in thinking of these pastimes again and again with great relish. In the circle of His own dearmost devotees, He constantly follows along those same wonderful pastimes. Dear mind! Just worship this moon-like Lord Gauranga-candra!",
  "In the evening, Shrimati Radharani travels to the pre-assigned pleasure-grove in the company of Her gopi-friends and waits impatiently for Krishna to arrive for Their secret rendezvous. When She receives news from a messenger about the activities and whereabouts of Her Beloved Lord Krishna, Her heart is completely overwhelmed with the most instense anxiety. Oh my! In exactly that same mood, Lord Gauranga travels to the courtyard of Shrivasa Pandita in the evening, walking hand on hip as Radha does. Afterwards, when He realizes that Shri Krishna has indeed arrived before Shri Radha, Lord Gauranga jubilantly dances and stumbles repeatedly, His body erupting in intense euphoria with torrents of tears and shivering limbs. Just worship the fair-complexioned Lord Gauranga!"
