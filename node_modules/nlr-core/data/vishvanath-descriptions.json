  "Continuing well into the night, Lord Gauranga dances and dances with Prabhu Nityananda in the courtyard of Shrivasa, surrounded by His most intimate devotees. His ecstatic singing is accompanied by the devotees who are expert in playing very loud rhytms on the mridanga drums. He wanders and dances with Shri Gadadhara Prabhu in the most astonishing way troughout the night, until just before dawn. Then He returns to His own home, where He retires to His bedchamber and falls asleep. I thus meditate on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga-nataraja.",
  "At the end of the night, upon hearing the pleasant sounds made by many birds such as cuckoos, roosters, and others, Lord Shri Gauranga arises from His bed. With His wife, Shri Vishnu-priya, He discusses many topics concerning the transcendental mellows of Their mutual loving affairs and thus They become very pleased. Then He gets up and goes to another room, wherein He sits upon a raised sitting place and is assisted by His devotees in washing His lotus face with nicely scented water. Thereafter, He very happily visits His mother, Shri Shachi Devi, as well as other friends and relatives in the home. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga-sundara.",
  "In the morning, after sunrise, Lord Gauranga goes with His associates to bathe in the holy river. While bathing, they also worship Mother Ganga by offering flowers, incense and other presentations. They then come onto the bank of the river, where He is dressed with exquisite cloth and decorated with fresh flower garlands, sandalwood paste and other ornaments. Returning to His home in order to perform opulent worship of Lord Vishnu, as well as other rituals, they later partake of the foodstuffs that were offered to Lord Vishnu. After washing His hand and mouth, Lord Gauranga goes into another room and rests very happily for awhile. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga-hari.",
  "Upon the arrival of the forenoon period, Lord Gauranga gets up from His nap and streches His body. Then He washes His lotus face with sweetly scented water. Meeting with His devotees, Who are all very fond of chanting Shri Gaurahari-nama-kirtana, He personally tastes and relishes the chanting of the holy names. Thus He sports, sometimes in the way, He increases the ecstatic pleasure of all the townspeople so much that it attains limitless heights. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga-chandra.",
  "During the midday period, Lord Gauranga continues to enjoy the performance of intensely enthusiastic chanting and dancing, surrounded by His own dear devotees such as the moon-like Advaita Acharya, Gadadhara Pandita, and the divine madman Shrila Nityananda Prabhu. Afterwards,they all wander throughout the gardens and groves on the bank of the Ganga, where they enjoy the sweet cooling breezes blowing over the river. Hearing the pleasant sounds of the bumblebees and the birds in those gardens, the Lord remembers His ecstatic pastimes as Radha and Krishna, which are occurring simultaneously in His own forest of Vrindavana. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Lord Gauranga.",
  "During the splendidly beautiful afternoon period, Lord Gauranga and His devotees all become equally maddened in ecstatic love, and thus they expand ever-increasing waves of auspicious benefit that ripple all through-out the three worlds. In this mood, they leave the gardens and travel back toward His home. Along the way, He satisfies the eyes of all the townspeople, just as the moon satisfies the chakora bird with its moonbeams. Reaching home, Lord Gauranga is met at the door by His mother and lavished with loving attentions. I meditate on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga.",
  "At dusk, the Lord bathes with His dear friends in the Ganga, the river who flows in the three parts. They devoutly worship the Ganga by offering ghee lamps, flowers, and other articles. Afterwards, the Lord puts on fresh silken clothes and is adorned with flower garlands. Then, He worships Lord Vishnu at home by performing the evening arati ceremony, offering ghee lamps and other items. Later, He and His friends partake of the foodstuffs and betel nuts that were offered to Lord Vishnu. I thus meditate on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga.",
  "In the evening time, Lord Gauranga goes to the home of Shrivasa Pandita, accompanied by Shrila Advaitachandra and other dear associates. Meeting with the multitude of His devotees, He tastes and relishes the nectar of topics about Lord Hari, and His mind becomes most agitated with the ecstasies of pure love of Godhead. Then, becoming very lustful to relish the congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord, Lord Gauranga orchestrates the performance of intensely jubilant sankirtana, which attains the summit of passionate glorification ,of these holy names. I thus meditate on the daily pastimes of Lord Gauranga-sundara."
