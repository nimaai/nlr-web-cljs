  "In the midday period He goes to an extremely enchanting flower garden and becomes absorbed in riding the sportive waves of limitless pastime after pastime along with His intimate associates.",
  "Description of the Flower Garden",
  "In this way Gauranga-Chandra comes to the flower garden and beholds the splendor of the forest with His red-tinged eyes. This flower garden is a grandly expansive place. In all four directions are groups of very tall kadamba trees. At the base of these kadamba trees are dense screwpine bushes which are encircled by thorns. Seeing this thorny forest from afar, the common people never come her. Madhavi and malati jasmine-vines climb up and embrace the kadamba trees. The pleasant south wind blows, carrying flower-pollen with its breezes. In four directions are four paths formed with jewels. In two directions are beautiful rows of bakula trees. The forest blooms with small white kunda-jasmine buds, splender, red amaranth, tagara flower-trees, groups of jewelled gardens, nageshvara flowers, and many other varieties of fragrant jasmines like jati, yuthi and mallika. Bakula trees, clove-pink vines, pink trumpet-flowers, and guelder-roses are beautifully manifest in row after row.",
  "White lilies, yellow magnolias, and many red flame-trees are blooming. Here and there are seen very enchanting jewelled altars above which the trees and creepers are formed like canopies The dark tamal trees are splendrous with their bunches of fresh sprouts and golden creepers that climb and encircle them. Temples bloom with trees of pinkish color accented here and there by flowering mango-saplings. At the base of the trees are seen beautiful groups of rose-apple bushes, jackfruits and so many juicy limes. The inner part of the forest is surrounded by groves of banana trees. Some are bearing ripe fruits while others bear unripe green ones. Rows and rows of coconut trees hold many, many fruits. Among the rows of betel trees are date-palms and wood-apple trees. There are sweet jujube berries, oranges, plums, plus cardamon and clove vines. All the fruit and flower-trees are so full with offerings that their branches bend down and touch the ground",
  "Pomegranates are bursting and soaking the ground with their juice. Hedges of jujube berries appear very beautiful. There are so many varieties of trees that they defy description. In the center of the garden is a colorful temple. Just in front of it is a lake full of cool waters. The landing-steps are formed of crystal slabs. On four sides are four bathing places inlaid with jewels. Surrounding the lake are lilies-of-the-valley formed of gold, white sephalika flowers, golden champaka creepers, and moonlike mallika jasmines. All these beautiful flowerbeds line the bank of the lake and their reflections can be seen in its pure waters. From the weight of all the flowers, their stems bend down and caress the surface of the water.",
  "Sweet little ripples move along with the gentle breeze. Lotuses of white, blue, red and more are in full bloom. These lotuses sway so much that the bumblebees cannot land on them. Greedy for honey, millions of bees fly all around. Royal swans, storks, herons, partridges and many other birds playfully sport in all directions. The fish living within the water move about by the hundreds.",
  "In a golden temple, upon a golden altar sits Lord Gauranga of golden complexion. Surrounding Him are His associates also of golden complexion, Their limbs tremble out of pure prema and their eyes are wet with tears. There are twelve gates supported by reddish-golden pillars. On the outside are golden posts holding up a nice canopy. These gates are interwoven with garlands of mallika-jasmines. The top edges have clusters of hanging sapphires that sway to and fro. The East courtyard has groves of divine Tulasi plants. The West courtyard has groves of colorful flame-trees. The North and South have grasses of dark Syamala color which bring to mind soft pillows to sit on. Pet deer roam all about in search of grass to eat and they spread their eyes wide upon beholding the beauty of Gauranga. A peacock alights from a magnolia tree upon seeing Gauranga there and begins to dance in great happiness.",
  "The trees and creepers all bloom with golden flowers. The forest is perpetually served by the Six Seasons. The sparrows chirp loudly and the cuckoos are all-pervading. Male and female waterfowl wander around on the ground. Parrots see ripe bimba berries and peck them with their beaks. Bluebirds and doves sport within the trees. Meditations on the Vrindavan Pastimes Female and male parrots call out, Jai Shri Shachi-Nandana! Glory to the life and soul of Narahari and Gadadhara ! Glory, glory to the Lord of Lakshmi Vishnu-Priya's life! Glory, glory to Radha and Krishna who have united in one form!",
  "'Glory, glory to He who has manifested all these desire-fulfilling trees ! Each and every one of our Vrindavan-vasis has increased their prema unlimitedly by sporting here in Navadvipa !' Vishvambhara hears these statements of the parrots and remembers the lila of Radha and Krishna at Radha-kunda within His mind.",
  "One moment He says, 'Who has stolen my flute?' The next moment He says, 'Just see! I have defeated you at dice!' The next moment He says, 'Let there be water-sports in this kunda!' The next moment He says. 'Come on! Let us go to the place of Surya-puja !'The next moment He begins walking, holding Gadadhara's hand. Thus He plays with His devotees in the flower garden. They adorn Him with flower armlets, necklaces, and hair-ties. They scatter flowers all around until the earth is completely covered. The fragrance attracts thick swarms of bumblebees hovering about.",
  "From moment-to-moment Lord Gauranga goes to the base of each and every tree and sports there, being cooled by the shade. They make relishable music as they play on mrdangas and vinas. Some dance and some make nice rhythms by clapping their hands. The sweetness of this forest is equal to that of Vrindavan and the Lord eternally sports here with His associates. Many groups of male servants clean up the groves. It is impossible to describe these limitless forest-pastimes. The servant of the servant of Shri Gauranga and Nityananda Krishna Dasa narrates the Lord's pastimes.",
