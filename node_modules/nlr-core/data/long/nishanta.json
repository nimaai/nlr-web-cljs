  "At the end of the night Lord Gauranga lies upon a nice bed under the spell of sleep. There is no person alive who could behold such splendor and retain his life-breath.",
  "At the end of the night Gauranga-chanda is in His sleeping chamber. His limbs twinkle as cupid churns His mind. The golden bedstead is inlaid with solid coral and is decorated with pillows covered with pure white cloth. The nicely-colored silk is secured by cords in four corners and the jeweled tassels emit pinkish rays in all directions. Tall,strong golden posts grace the four corners supporting the expansive canopy hanging overhead.",
  "Swinging from all edges are long strands of very tiny pearls which appear like the celestial river flowing down from the heavens. The bedstead appears just like the nicely-formed pear of Mt.Kailasa While he splendrous bolsters appear like balls of fresh cream.",
  "Covering the mattress is pure white silk in the middle of which slumbers Gauranga Dvija-mani the jewel of the twice-born brahmanas. His long limbs put to shame the luster of molten gold while overwhelmed with the moods of lazy lounging He rolled over until He was lying on His stomach. The upward lines pf His beautilul tilak shine with the splendor of sandalwood paste.",
  "Around His face the dots of kunkum and musk are enchanting. Jewelled earrings rest against His glistening cheeks while the arch of His eyebrows conquers the arrows of Cupid. Attempting to find a suitable comparison for the splendor of Gauranga's closed eyes even the Creator with all his skills of supremely refined craftsmanship is baffled to the utmost extent of his imagination.",
  "I can understand that Kamadeva has vanished in fear of the crooked arch of Gauranga's eyebrows; becoming bodiless, Cupid is therefore called Ananga.",
  "Who has created this form of Lord Gauranga's? It is like Cupid's net for ensnaring the innocent deer that are the hearts of chaste girls. His two lotuslike eyes are closed in repose. His thick black eyelashes are motionless. His splendidly-colored lips defeat the hue of bimba-fruits while His slightly smiling mouth enraptures the universe.",
  "His broad chest is beautified by numerous necklaces and His arms extending to His knees are very muscular. His arms are adorned with bracelets of nine jewels and His divine form is beautified with thick patches of sandalwood paste. His hips are wrapped with very fine white cloth while His upper body is partially covered with a splendrous cloth the border of which is woven in ornate golden flowers. His thin brahmana thread is visible there, supremely pure and white. The palms of His hands are reddish like blooming water-lotuses and the sparkling auras of His finger-rings destroy darkness all around.",
  "The nicely-constructed golden temple is pervaded with happiness. On the four sides are four bejeweled terraces with gazebos. On top of the temple are flags and golden jugs and strands of pearls so large that they look like full moons. Both sides of the temple are beautified by eight crystal pillars supporting rows of swan formed of silver.",
  "Shrivasa Angana",
  "In four directions are four gates that are studded with jewels and inlaid here and there with emerald. The golden doors shine with their solid coral bolts and crystal cornices glitter like rows of candles. Ranks of huge mirrors are fixed on the walls and they are painted with scenes of the mellow-sports of Radha and Krishna. These spotless mirrors are also embellished here and there with artificial flower-trees and lotus flowers with hundreds of petals. These ornamentations on the mirrors radiate a luster so much like real lotuses that swarms of bumblebees wander here. mistaking them for actual lotus-groves.",
  "The four directions shine with eight round windows on the doors which are expert in mocking the orb of the sun. These round windows are lined with brilliant sunstones that are bordered on the inside and outside edges with rubies. The temple's altar, vestibule, courtyard and staircases are beautifully formed of solid crystal slaps.",
  "Within the temple, by the sleeping-chamber, is a flower -garden. Sitting upon branches here and there are cuckoos and other birds. The cool breeze flows with the pleasant fragrances of various flowers while the branches of the trees sway along ever so gently . Hanging upon the door of this inner chamber is the lovely sight of shoes ,umbrella and pure white chamara whisk. On both sides of the bed are golden tables supporting jeweled boxes containing betel-nut packets and golden pitchers full of scented water. On the floor in front of these tables is a beautiful place for rinsing the mouth.",
  "Lord Gauranga is Awakened",
  "Overcome with the fatigue of sporting vigorous kirtana the moonlike Gauranga-Shashi sleeps upon the bed. In the corner of the room sits a parrot in a golden cage. Seeing that the night has ended, the parrot becomes restless. With a blissful mind he thinks to himself, 'I will wake Gauranga' as his wings blossom with thrill-bumps and his eyes flow with tears.",
  "He calls out with a very sweet voice, 'Arise , Gauranga-Raya! The dew is settling upon the morning. Seeing the approaching pink of the rising sun, the bumblebees have abandoned their resting-place in the lotus flowers.'",
  "Seeing the directions illumined with glorious light the she-herons have arisen and playfully come to mingle with the he-herons. The swans and cranes and other water-dwelling birds have all gone to the bank of the celestial Sura-dhuni river (Ganga). All the birds headed by the doves have begun their cooing and chirping and the people stir about the town , seeing to their own work. The he-deer and she-deer have left their formation and wander in smaller groups for grazing on fresh grasses.",
  "His sleep broken upon hearing the words of the parrot. His two lotus eyes open ever so slightly. In His mind He is fully aware of the kunja-lila of Vrindavan and thus meditating on the dawn pastimes performed by Radha and Krishna in Their bowerhouse. He remains motionless and pretends to continue sleeping. In another room sleeps Shrimati Vishnu-Priya Devi who quickly gets out of her bed upon seeing the arrival of morning. She walks slowly in drowsiness and goes to Shachi's courtyard while her eyes roll to and fro.",
  "Hearing the sweet relishable sound of Vishnu-Priya's anklets and ornaments, Shachi opens the door and steps outside to greet her. Seeing her daughter-in-law, she speaks in pleasant words 'I am busy with household chores now. You may go and bathe in the Sura-dhuni.' Then, in order to pamper her son, Shachi proceeds very quickly with anxious mind.",
  "Entering His sleeping-chamber, she silently comes before His bed. Stroking His divine form very. very tenderly with her hand he considerately speaks in a soft and gentle voice, 'Arise, dear son Gauranga-Chanda, it is morning. The townspeople have arisen and are sitting in anticipation. Shrivasa and all the other devotees are very anxiously waiting to see you. Please get up and quickly start on the path Give up your sleep, arise and go wash your face.'",
  "The Lord Begins His Day Hearing His mother's words, Gauranga-Raya stretches His body and sits up in the bed. At this moment , Sita Thakurani (the wife of Shri Advaita) arrives along with Malini (the wife of Shrivasa Pandita) and other chaste wives of the devotees. Having all come and met together at Shachi's home they enter Gauranga's sleeping chamber. All the ladies of the town also proceed there with anxious minds just to have darshan of Gauranga. Mother Shachi lights a ghee-lamp scented with camphor on a golden tray, then jubilantly places it in the hands of Malini (wife of Shrivasa Thakura), who offers it as arati to the gorgeous Gauranga-Sundara.",
  "The male servants attentively bring in a golden footstool, full water pitchers, a tongue scraper, tooth powder, and so forth. Leaving the room, Gauranga comes out into the courtyard. Going to another room in the house, He conducts His morning activities. Then He comes out and sits down with His foot upon a footstool. After brushing His teeth and other duties, He goes and sits on a very elevated sitting place. Then His devotees, who have also just finished their morning practices, begin to arrive - Prabhu Nityananda, Shri Advaita, Gadadhara, Mukunda, Murari, Haridasa, Vakreshvara, Shuklambara Brahmachari, Shridhara and others.",
  "Coming together at the Lord's house, all the devotees successively offer their respects at His feet in the appropriate manner. Then Prabhu Nityananda comes and sits to the Lord's right with Gadadhara on the left and devotees on all four sides. Before Them sits Advaita , the Lord of Shanti-pura. What splendor manifests here! It cannot even be described with words! Description of Shrimati Vishnu-Priya's Beauty Then Vishnu-Priya Devi very playfully goes in the company of her girlfriends to bathe in the Sura-dhuni river. The complexion of her body conquers that of a golden lotus and her most lovely face radiates the splendor of how many moons? Her braid graces her hips like a great snake and it is bound with golden threads interwoven with strands of bakula flowers. Her wavy locks appear to be swarms of bumblebees and her two cheeks sparkle like mirrors.Her ears are adorned with jewel-studded earrings swinging from which are tiny ornaments inlaid with pearls.",
  "To support the weight of this extraordinary ear-ornament a golden chain, is fastened to a post in her earlobe and loops over her ear. The part in her hair is bordered by tiny pearls tied on golden threads and interspersed with rubies. On her forehead is a dot of sindura tinted reddish like the rising sun both sides of which are embellished with designs drawn in dark musk. Further designs in musk beautify her cheeks and her pleasingly-colored lips form an enchantingly gentle smile. Her fickle eyes dart about like the movements of a wagtail bird as Cupid himself trembles in fear to see the movements of her eyebrows.",
  "Her nose conquers the beauty of the sesame flower and an elephant-pearl swings from it. Around her neck is an ornamental necklace interwoven with jasmine garlands From her neck descends a splendrous array of golden necklaces, arranged in successive loops from small to large. The beauty of her breasts puts to shame that of golden waterpitchers and they are encircled with champaka flowerbuds. Her breasts are adorned with vines drawn in sandalwood paste and bordered with strands of precious elephant-pearls. Her two arms appear as golden lotus-stems and they are decorated with conchshell-bangles and other ornaments. Her upper arms are encircled by armlets that are bordered with silk dangling from which, are golden charms. From her reddish palms extend fingers adorned with rings and her index finger shines with a golden ornament that is studded with mirrors. Her entire form is made lustrous y her divine raincloud-colored silken cloth its border studded with sparkling jewels and precious jari weavings.",
  "Her hips are broad and her waist is slim. Orchid-jewels playfully dance upon her ornamental belt. Her feet are decorated with reddish lac-dye and her anklebells are trimmed with Jewels Her sweet gait mocks that of a royal swan as her anklets resound like the chirping of sparrows. Her entire body ridicules the softness of fresh cream. Amidst jokes and laughter she bathes in the Sura-dhuni.",
  "Thus Ends the Nishanta-Lila."
