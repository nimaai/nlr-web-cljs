Then Sita Devi, Malini and the wives of all the dear devotees also finish their baths and proceed at once to Shachi's home. Going inside, they carefully receive the finest items to offer the Lord that are brought from their homes by maidservants. Shachi Mata takes the items along and washing her feet enters the kitchen.",
  "Approaching Vishnu-Priya Devi, Shachi says 'It is so late! Alas! Please begin cooking!' Very happy in her mind to receive this order, Vishnu-Priya immediately goes and sits down to cook. All the cooking duties performed by Malini are directed by the gestures of Sita Thakurani. First they cook sweet rice. Upon its completion it is transferred to a new container.

  "Ripe mango pieces are marinated in sugar-sauce. Shachi has been keeping them soaking for many days. There are mustard-powder soup, plum pickles and many more things that are brought and placed outside. Then Shachi Devi comes into the kitchen and is overjoyed to view the assortment of cooked preparations. She addresses her daughter-in-law. 'What is the delay with the cooking?' Vishnu-Priya is embarrassed and does not say a word in reply. So Malini speaks up. 'Oh Shachi Devi ! The cooking is finished. There is no more delay.' Shachi says, 'Good! I have personally cleaned Lord Vishnu's eating-room with my own hands. Now I am quickly going to arrange the offering there.' Saying this, she goes outside and says to Ishana. 'Please ask Vishvambhara to immediately take His bath in the Ganga. It is upsetting my mind that we are so late today - the rice and cooked vegetables are getting cold!'",
  "Gauranga Mahaprabhu Goes to Bathe in the Ganga",
  "Ishana goes and addresses the Lord. 'Mata has asked me to tell you to go bathe in the Ganga now.' Hearing this, Gauranga Mahaprabhu feels very blissful in His mind and leaves with His devotees for bathing The devotees gather flower garlands, ground sandalwood pulp, scented oil for massaging His body and clean clothes as they depart for the river. Along the way , He has many conversations with the devotees. Then, in their company Shri Gauranga Raya enters the waters of the Ganga and offers His obeisances unto her.",
  "(From the Chaitanya Bhagavat)",
  "'Who could possibly describe the opulence of Nadiya? At one bathing place, thousands and thousands of people bathe Some are peaceful saints, some austere ascetics, some sannyasis I don't know how many children come there and mix in the crowds! The Jahnavi (Ganga) encircles the Lord on all sides and He secretly offers her own water unto her ripples On the plea of making waves, the Jahnavi dances even though her feet are served by residents of limitless universes. Navadvipa Raya played water-sports in the Ganga river while the residents of Nadiya looked on in the greatest fortune. As Prabhu Vishvambhara played in the waters of the Ganga He looked just like the full moon itself playing in the ocean All the fortunate souls who had come to the landing to bathe incessantly beheld the face of Vishvambhar. ' One male servant (dasa) comes forward to massage the Lord attentively rubbing and cleansing His body. Then Prabhu bathes in the company of His devotees and they ascend the riverbank with much playful sporting. Another dasa comes forward to wipe His body dry carefully disentangling and dressing His hair. Helping Him change into dry clothes he adorns Him with divine flower garlands, sandalwood paste and ornaments for each and every limb.",
  "The Offering",
  "On returning home, Prabhu Gauranga Shri Hari washes His feet and enters the temple room of Lord Vishnu ( From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat:) Gauranga Bhagavan properly performs Vishnu-puja. Offering water with Tulasi , He then offers obeisances. Then Prabhu comes and sits upon a golden platform and offers the sweetmeats to Lord Vishnu. Shachi Devi carefully brings the items on golden plates and places them before her son. Offering scented water from a golden vessel, He sits alone and feeds the Lord some nice edibles. All the devotees headed by Nityananda Prabhu , Advaita Gosai, Narahari, Gadadhara, Shrivasa, Ramai, Vakreshvara, Haridasa and others had returned to their own homes after bathing in the Ganga. Each performing their own morning duties they again come together to meet at Prabhu's house. Then Vishnu-Priya Devi finishes her cooking.",
  "On Shachi's order she goes to the offering-room and places various types of rice on many golden plates; lining them up in mound after mound, she sprinkles them with ghee. All the vegetable preparations that were cooked are plied alongside the rice in successive order. All the cooked grains as well as all the pickled items are arranged in row after row according to the progression of their taste. Water is poured into a golden vessel and is scented with camphor. The finest betel nuts are made pleasant by adding cloves and cardamon and are put into a bejewelled box. Placing Tulasi-manjaris upon the grains she offers the food to the Shaligram while giving Him achamana.",
  "The Morning meal",
  "Then Shachi Devi very jubilantly calls her son and His friends to eat. Nityananda accompanies the Lord and His devotees as they quickly come, Gauranga-Chandra washes His feet and sits upon a majestic seat Nityananda and Gadadhara sit on either side of Him, while Advaita and Shrivasa sit facing them. All the devotees sit in the courtyard while Shachi blissfully serves them. Again and again she brings and serves all the cooked offerings. Overwhelmed with affection she makes them eat while all their chaste wives stand and watch from afar. Lord Gauranga laughs and jokes while He eats as the male servants bring and serve water. Washing His mouth, He goes and sits on an asana as all the devotees sit surrounding Him on all sides. Prabhu eats betel nuts and laughs, while some attendants serve Him by waving chamara whisks. Then Sita Devi takes Malini and the devotees' wives. Shachi comes forward and seats them all, feeding them to the great delight of her heart. After eating the wives return to their own homes and Shachi finally eats along with Vishnu-Priya. They wash their mouths and go to sit in a solitary place, as the servants headed by Ishana come for their own meal. The servants then clean the house. After washing all the pots and plates they put them away. Nityananda and the other devotees go to take a little rest. Seeing His devotees off , Prabhu Vishvambhara enters the sleeping chamber. Lying on His bed He goes to sleep while some dear one massages His feet. A few devotees headed by Gadadhara and Narahari also rest along with the Lord In His house. The servant of the servant of Shri Gauranga and Nityananda, Krishna Dasa narrates the Lord's pastimes.",
