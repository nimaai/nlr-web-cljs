  "Then all the male-servants act very quickly filling golden pitchers with water and bringing them in. One washes the Lord's feet. One combs out His hair and ties it in a topknot. His body is cleansed with scented water. Finally rinsing Him again, they cover Him with fine white cloth and offer Him fresh clothing and ornaments. Gaurahari then enters the temple of Lord Vishnu. On Shachi's order, Devi Vishnu-Priya lights a lamp and goes into the temple. On the altar is a murti of Raghunatha in the form of a rock (shila). Prabhu performs the arati and bows down to offer obeisances . He brings and offers many gifts to the deity. Giving the image achaman He then puts Him to rest. Gauranga comes out of the temple and sits upon a divine lion-throne as Shachi's bliss knows no bounds. All the offerings that were presented to the deity in the Vishnu temple are saved separately for the evening. Some items are brought out and placed before Shachi's son and Lord Gauranga smilingly eats in the greatest happiness. After washing His mouth. Gauranga Raya sits down again as Vishnu-Priya Devi remains nearby to offer Him betel.",
  "(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat)",
  "Knowing the intense bliss of His mother's heart Lord Gauranga stays there and sits with Lakshmi.",
  "Lord Guaranga Proceeds to Shrivasa's House",
  "Then suddenly Lord Gauranga becomes obsessed in his mind and He departs for Shrivasa's house. What splendor is seen during this dusk time ! In the four directions is a great tumult of singing and music. Brilliant lamps are lit by the streets in row after row making all the town spotlessly pure by their effulgence. Travelling on the path like a maddened lion. Lord Gauranga eventually arrives at Shrivasa's residence. Seeing Prabhu come in, Shrivasa becomes very Jubilant and a great ecstasy blossoms among he and his family members. Bowing at His feet they wash them, then take and seat Him upon a divine lion-throne",
  "The servant of the servant of Shri Gauranga and Nityananda Krishna Dasa narrates the Lord's pastimes. Thus Ends the Sayan-Lila"
