  "At night Lord Gauranga happily performs sankirtana along with His closest associates. Later He goes to the home of His beloved wife. Thus narrates Krishna Dasa.",
  "Lord Gauranga Begins the Sankirtan",
  "Then Gauranga Mahaprabhu's divine moonlike face beams in a wide smile and He gives the order to begin the kirtan. ( From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat)",
  "Hearing this from the Lord , all the Vaishnavas were overjoyed and thus Gauranga Mahaprabhu began the grand sport of kirtan. This kirtan was held every night at Shrivasa's home and occasionally at Chandra-Shekhara's. Mukunda commenced with the auspicious invocation of the kirtan and then chanted 'Rama Krishna Narahari Gopala Govinda !' Everyone was there - Nityananda, Gadadhara, Advaita, Shrivasa, Vidya-Nidhi, Murari, Hiranya, Haridasa, Gangadasa Vanamali, Vijaya-Nandana, Jagadananda, Buddhimanta Khan, Narayana, Kashishvara, Vasudeva, Rama, Garuda, Govinda, Govindananda, Gopinatha, Jagadisha, Shriman, Shridhara, Sadashiva, Vakreshvara, Bhugarbha,Shuklambara, Brahmananda, Purushottama, Sanjaya, and so on -uncountable servants of Shri Gauranga were there - I know them all by name. All of them were present together during Lord Gauranga's dancing and other than His own personal associates, no one else was there.",
  "Hearing the loud shouting of Prabhu, mixed with the cries of 'Hari! Hari!' in the night - it was as if the universe was being split open. All the sinful souls were perishing in this tumult as Shachi-Nandana Gauranga ecstatically performed His kirtan. Seeing everyone forcefully tumbling and falling 'upon the ground, Govinda Dasa came forward and shut his eyes. Sometimes Gauranga manifested Himself in the mood of God and sometimes He would weep and exclaim, 'I am but a lowly servant!' Thus in the sacred courtyard of Shrivasa the auspicious uproar of ktrtan arose with the names 'Gopala ! Govinda !'",
  "The Ecstatic Chanting and Dancing Escalates",
  "Shrivasa took charge of one group as Mukunda took another and ran this way and that. Govinda Datta took charge of yet another and everyone did kirtan as Gauranga-Chandra danced. Sometimes the greatly muscular Nityananda would grab hold of Lord Gauranga, as Advaita secretly took the dust of His feet. Gadadhara and his group had tearful eyes and were completely overcome with bliss by Lord Gauranga's kirtan. When Prabhu Vishvambhara danced and stomped vigorously on the ground the earth trembled and everyone scattered in fear. Sometimes as Lord Gauranga Vishvambhara danced at a moderate pace, He appeared to be Lord Krishna Nanda-Nandana, the best of dancers. The next moment meditating inwardly, He would hold His bands as if He were playing a flute and thus looked exactly like Vrindavan-Chandra Himself. When He manifested this mood it was totally astonishing as the son of Jagannatha Mishra was suspended in the bliss of His own Holy Names.",
  "From moment-to-moment great perspiration would flow from His pores,appearing like the Ganga had personally come from His body. Seeing Lord Gauranga's ecstatic bliss, the Bhagavata devotees held each others' necks and wept. The divine limbs of everyone were smeared with divine chandan and they were adorrned with flower garlands. Ecstatically chanting Krishna's name they forgot all else in the world. The sounds of the mridangas, small finger-cymbals, and- conchshells mixed with the sankirtan in a thunderous blend of excitement. This tumult arose in the universe and filled the sky vanquishing inauspiciousness in all directions. What a wonder that upon the dancing of Whose servants all troubles were destroyed and the universe was made pure! Thus Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu personally danced to the chanting of His own holy names. What is the result of all this? These pastimes of Shri Gauranga were foretold in the ancient Puranas.",
  "In four directions resounded the most auspicious Shri Harinama Sankirtan and in the middle danced the son of Jagannatha Mishra. Absorbed in the bliss of Whose holy name, Lord Shiva does not know that he is naked, By Whose name Lord Brahma dances while He Himself also dances, By Whose name Valmiki became a great ascetic, By Whose name Ajamila was liberated, Whose name is taken by Shuka and Narada as they wander, Whose glories are sung by Shesha of a thousand mouths, in the bliss of His own names dances Prabhu Gauranga Vishvambhara. The rhythm of His feet striking the earth is most enchanting. Lord Gauranga looks at all the Vaishnavas one by one. Overcome with ecstatic moods, the devotees loudly repeat the names of the Lord's previous incarnations. Even Lord Haladhara, Shiva, Shuka, Narada, Prahlada, Lakshmi, Aja, nd Uddhava all chanted along with this kirtan of Lord Gauranga. As before, great care is taken that no outsiders enter the courtyard and behold this scene. Just as so many yugas elapsed during the performance of the maha-rasa dance - all the gopis in this present incarnation now consider such a length of time to pass like half a mustard-seed. In this way Krishna's inconceivable manifestation blossomed and only the fortunate servants of Shri Gauranga could come here.",
  "(There is a poem in this regard) 'Jaya re! Jaya re! Gauranga Shri Shachi-Nandana of lovely form dances auspiciously! His qualities are sung in ecstatic kirtan by Shrivasa, Ramananda, Mukunda and Vasu. The drums resound 'dram drimiki drimiki drimi' as the relishabIe finger-cymbals chime along sweetly. The hearts of his associates are pierced by flower-arrows, overwhelming them in ecstatic moods.'",
  "The Glories of Gadadhara Pandita",
  "(A song by Lochana Dasa Thakura)",
  "Glories, glories to Gadadhara and Gauranga-Sundara! They are one soul manifest in two separate bodies! Radha and Krishna, the fresh young couple of Vrindavan have now appeared here as Gadadhara and Gauranga-Chandra. Radha Vrindavaneshvari is the personification of maha-bhava - She has now incarnated as Gadadhara Pandita.",
  "And Vrajendra-Nandana is the personification of the King of rasa - He has fully manifested as this Gauranga-Chandra. One who endeavors to worship on the raganuga-marga the path of spontaneous devotion follows the disciples of Pandita Gosai (Gadadhara Pandita). Without following them, Vraja cannot be attained. Therefore the Goswamis of Vraja are branches of this disciplic succession. He whom LakshmiDevi meditates upon, even executing austerities for the purpose of attaining Him, but still not attaining her desire - this Vrajendra-Nandana is truly loved by Radha.",
  "Indeed, She is overwhelmed with prema for Him at every moment nd now this Radha has become Gadadhara Panitta Gosai who is madly engrossed in the nectar-mellows of Gauranga-prema. Therefore one who is devoid of attachment to Gadadhara cannot attain prema-bhakti, but instead becomes totally destitute. If someone does not believe in this principle he cannot be delivered for a million births, and is completely ruined.",
  "My prayer at the feet of Gadadhara-Gauranga is that I have never had association with Your true followers. I have been pleased to associate with sinful atheists and I am pierced by the spears of Gadadhara Pandita's blasphemers. My mind is full of attachment to drinking liquor and I have frightfully kept the company of other drunkards. Still, perpetually hoping for the lotus feet of Gadadhara-Gauranga Lochana Dasa begs for shelter under these feet.",
  "(Another song by Lochana Dasa)",
  "Dear mind, just worship, just worship the son of Madhava known as Gadadhara! Whoever takes shelter of his lotus feet goes to Vraja-dhama. Previously he appeared in Vrishabhanu's house at Vraja-pura bearing the name Radhika. In the company of Her girlfriends, fond of playful pranks, She serves Shyama Krishna and makes Him happy. That form is now this form, the same Queen of relishable mellows. Just worship Her incessantly with single-minded attention. Now in the company of Gauranga , Radha has incarnated and sports playfully in the dress of a renounced male ascetic Gadadhara. Coming to Nilachala and living in the company of many devotees Gadadhara has delivered many countries. The entire universe is swimming in the flood of prema that he has brought , which vanquished all the miseries of everyone. But this sinful soul has never seen that cean of prema, says Lochana Dasa.",
  "(Another song by Lochana Dasa)",
  "In hope for Gadadhara, Gadadhara, Gadadhara - if you attain Gadadhara you get residence in Vraja-pura. Taking the name of Gadadhara I will become an ascetic. I will eat from my waterpot and wear a simple loincloth. These are the hopes of my mind for many days now. With my ears I will hear about Gadadhara-Gauranga-prema.Dear Lords! Only those who know You can be a guru or a disciple in Your lineage. Only persons bereft of eyes reject You and uselessly attempt to perform devotional service. One who is devoid of attachment to Gadadhara's lotus feet remains fallen in the ocean of birth and death.",
  "In hope of attaining the lotus feet of Gadadhara, Lochana Dasa begs for remembrance of those feet.",
  "(Another poem)",
  "Re! Some say that Gauranga is Janaki-vallabha (Lord Rama), the beloved of Radha, or Pancha Vana (Cupid with 5 flower arrows). But in the mind of the poet Nayanananda I know nothing other than this - that Gauranga is the life and soul of my Gadadhara . Re !' The Kirtan is Concluded. Thus Gauranga-Sundara frolics in the happiness of kirtana.",
  "As the late night enters the second prahara. After some time Lord Gauranga stops the chanting and sits in the courtyard with His devotees. His dear companions wave fans to alleviate the fatigue of the kirtana. Shachi Devi takes Lakshmi Vishnu-Priya along and quickly leaves for home. The other family members of the bhaktas also happily leave for their own residences. Arriving at home, Shachi Devi bids her daughter-in-law goodnight and goes inside feeling boundless bliss. Then Shachi begins to prepare edibles - and fixes her eyes on the path where Gauranga will appear. Gauranga bids farewell to all the devotees and proceeds toward His own home. On some nights after kirtan during the Summertime He bathes in the Ganga with the devotees in the moonlight. Arriving at home, servants wipe His body with fine damp cloths to relieve His fatigue from sporting so much chanting and dancing during the kirtan. Changing Him into fresh clothes they wash His sacred feet and He sits upon an asana to take prasad. Shachi Devi brings numerous offerings on golden trays and places them within the sight of her son. She comes over and sits before Him to behold His face and overflowing with pure loving affection, she eagerly urges Him to feast again and again.",
  "Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu eats while smiling gently as Lakshmi Vishnu-Priya looks on , filling her eyes. Finishing His meal Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu washes His mouth and sitting in a solitary place He chews betel nuts. Then He goes to His sleeping-chamber and lies down to rest upon the opulent bed. Whatever food remnants are leftover from Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu's plate are honored by Lakshmi Vishnu-Priya. All the servants headed by Ishana clean the house and go to take rest in their own quarters. Then Lakshmi Vishnu-Priya quickly goes to the Lord Gauranga's chamber and secretly serves his lotus feet.",
  "(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavata)",
  "After eating, Prabhu chews betel and goes to lie down, while Lakshmi takes His lotus feet.",
  "On some days the devotees headed by Haridasa and Gadadhara also rest in Lord Gauranga's house. Nityananda Prabhu comes here and takes his meal resting afterwards in great delight. Advaita , Shri Gadadhara , Vakreshvara, Shrivasa, Shri Narahari and all the other associates go to take rest in their own homes. Having their meals they then go to sleep.",
  "(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat)",
"These pastimes we being performed by Gauranga Raya even up to the present moment. Occasionally some fortunate souls catch a glimpse of it. In the dead of night all becomes still as Gauranga-Sundara happily falls sleep. The servant of the servant of Shri Gauranga and Nityananda, Krishna Dasa narrates the Lord's pastimes.",
  "Thus Ends the Nisha-Lila."
