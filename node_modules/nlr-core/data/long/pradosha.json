  "In the evening Lord Gauranga goes to Shrivasa's house while His heart blossoms in great delight . There He performs amazing pastimes according to the wishes of His dear friends.",
  "The Evening Arati of Shri Gauranga",
  "Then Nityananda Prabhu arrives and meets with everyone. He sits to Mahaprabhu's right with his face blossoming. Then comes Advalta-Chandra, the ocean of prema and Gadadhara, Narahari, Mukunda, Shridhara, Vakreshvara, Haridasa and all the assembly of devotees. Everyone arrives quickly at Shrivasa's house. Nityananda Raya holds an umbrella over the Lord's head. On the left is Gadadhara waving a chamara whisk. Someone dances, someone sings, and someone does kirtan. Someone lights a jewelled lamp and stands holding it. Inside the house the womenfolk are chanting 'Jaya ! Jaya !' as the pleasant sounds of mridangas, karatalas and bells reverberate. Advaita Gosai lights a ghee-lamp with five large wicks and performs arati while his inner bliss knows no bounds.",
  "(Thus a song by Narahari to be sung in raga Gauri) (Refrain)",
  "Glories, glories to the arati of Gauranga-Kishora! Sporting upon a simhasana, He appears to be a golden mountain. Stealing the overflowing hearts of all the young women in the universe.",
  "Shri Advaita, brimming full of ecstatic prema performs the arati overwhelmed with delight while gazing upon his own Lord. To the right is Nityananda-Chandra, radiant with uncommon mannerisms deeply absorbed in transcendental mellows. To the left is Gadadhara striking elegant poses holding up a new and brilliant umbrella. Shrivasa throws showers and showers of fIowers while Narahari continuously waves a chamara whisk. Shuklambara daubs the Lord with chandan while Gupta Murari shouts 'Jaya!' Madhava, Vasu Ghosha, Purushottama. Vijaya, Mukunda and other great souls of royal caliber are singing sweet ragas endowed with matchless embellishments like shruti, murachana , grama, sapta-svara and so forth. They play expertly on mridangas. tom-toms, small dampha drums, flutes, tiny high-pitched flutes and more. Bells and cymbals resound with loud ringing , while deafening dish-shaped gongs clang out dense reverberations. Vakreshvara dances in supreme exhilaration with luscious movements cavorting and spinning round and round. Someone sings the rhythms 'thai thai thai' in various ways according to strictly precise musical rules. The rasikas Gadadhara, Shridhara, Gauridasa and Haridasa dance while overwhelmed and saturated with rasa. Gauranga's face beams a sweet nectarean smile as He marvels.",
  "'How wonderfully these devotees perform in extreme madness!' The demigods in the sky are engrossed in this vision and their king Indra is able to leave only after great effort. The husband of Parvati and the four-faced one experience shivers of delight as copious tears continuously cascade from their eyes. The three worlds are excitedly jubilant as Shesha chants descriptions of this scene narrating the names of the participating munis and devotees. Narahari's Lord is the ornament of Vraja, saturated with rasa, the distributor of supremely matchless bliss in Nadiya-pura",
  "All the Devotees Gather at Shrivasa's House",
  "After completing the arati ceremony, Advaita Thakura shouts very loudly and begins dancing wildly. All the other devotees that live in the area arrive one by one and meet with those already at Shrivasa's house. Shachi Devi takes her daughter-in-law to the front of the house along with Sita Devi and gathers with all the devotees' wives. They stay in the house and gaze at the beauty of Gauranga outside. As Lord Gauranga gestures, the devotees open the gate and allow His various associates entrance into the courtyard.",
  "(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat)",
  "'The door on the gate was opened only on the order of Lord Gauranga so that no one other than His own associates could enter' The son of Shachi sits smiling upon a simhasana attracting the minds of all by His own divine beauty and qualities Nityananda, Gadadhara , Advaita , Shrivasa and everyone else continuously swims in the ocean of ecstatic love. Upon the arrival of nightfall all become very jubilant and their moods are clearly revealed in their behavior someone offers prayers, someone renders various services, someone offers palmfuls of flowers at the Lord's sacred feet. Someone brings and presents diverse offerings, Someone offers betel into His mouth while feeling limitless bliss. Lord Gauranga sits for a while enjoying the pleasure of Krishna-katha. This fathomless Pradosha-Lila defies description. The servant of the servant of Shri Gauranga and Nityananda, Krishna Dasa narrates the Lord Gauranga's pastimes",
  "Thus Ends the Pradosha-Lila"
