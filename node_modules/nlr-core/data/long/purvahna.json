  "In the forenoon period He visits the homes of devotees like Shuklambara and others and become totally overwhelmed immersed in ecstatic love as He sports various pastimes.",
  "Waking Up From the Nap",
  "After a short while Prabhu Vishvambhara awakens and sits up in bed. The other devotees headed by Gadadhara also wake up and are served water brought in golden pitchers by the male servants. Then Lord Gauranga washes His face and sits down with a supremely blissful mind. After resting briefly all the devotees carefully attend their own duties. They are very eager to meet with the Lord, but knowing it is not time yet , they do not go to Him. Some of them deliberate on the Bhagavat-shastra. Some of them mingle in Advaita's room. Some of them gather in groups of five or seven and perform kirtan while clapping their hands. Thus the devotees associate together each in their own way. Later all the bhaktas headed by Shrivasa arrive at Lord Gauranga's house. Offering obeisances at the Lord's feet they stay on the ground ut the Lord embraces them all and makes them sit nicely.",
  "Visiting The Devotees' homes",
  "Then in the company of Gadadhara and the others Lord Gauranga proceeds to Shuklambara's house in a mood of great sportive fun.",
  "(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat)",
  "'He incessantly remained in the company of Gadadhara; indeed, Prabhu could not be separated from Gadadhara for even a moment.' Shuklambara Brahmachari sees his own Lord and respectfully gets up abandoning whatever he is doing. Bowing at His feet, he washes them and seats Gauranga Mahaprabhu on an elevated asana. Nityananda and Gadadhara sit by His side while Advaita and all the other devotees sit facing them. Shuklambara's house is close by the Jahnavi river. There sports Gauranga of beautiful body. The bank of the Sura-dhuni is lined with rows of kadamba trees. There are thousands and thousands of peacocks, cuckoos and bees buzzing. The Lord's mind is overwhelmed with the remembrance of the Yamuna river and He has a vision of Krishna herding cows in the pastures. Thus He calls out with great feeling, O Shridama ! Sudama ! Stoka Krishna! He Arjuna! 0 Brother Balarama!' Seeing Mahaprabhu's condition, the hearts of Gadadhara and the others are overcome with ecstasy as their eyes brim with tears. In this mood they sport numerous pastimes.",
  "Then Gauranga Shri Hari gets up and quickly proceeds to Shridhara's house. Seeing Gauranga arrive along with His associates, Shridhara gets up. Offering water at their feet, he bows down respectfully. Gauranga Mahaprabhu sits with blossoming face as His devotees surround Him on all sides. He laughs and converses with Shridhara. Seeing He of such enchanting beauty with Shridhara, I can find no words and become a little stunned. Staying at Shridhara's house for a short while Prabhu gets up and leaves walking in the manner of a maddened baby elephant.",
  "(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat)",
  "'Lord Gauranga perpetually goes to everyone's house and reveals to them the visions of Chatur-bhuja (four-armed form), Sad-bhuja (six-armed form) and so forth. At one moment He goes to Gangadasa Murari's home and at the next moment He goes to Acharya-Ratna's home. Then, Prabhu takes His devotees and sits in a heavenly flower garden. The servant of the servant of Shri Gauranga and Nityananda, Krishna Dasa narrates the Lord's pastimes."
