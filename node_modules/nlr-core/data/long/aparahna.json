  "In the afternoon Lord Gauranga meets with His beloved friends and dresses in garments that enchant all the worlds . Wandering throughout the town of Nadiya to each and every house He displays wondrous glory that has no end",
  "The Lord Tours the Town Navadvip",
  "Then Gadadhara smiles and sweetly addresses the Lord: 'The afternoon time is approaching! Shachi Mata is very anxious for you! She has labored to make many fine edibles! Arranging them nicely on a golden plate, she waits and watches on the path for your return.' Hearing these words of Gadadhara, Prabhu says Let us go! and proceeds on his tour of the town. As Gauranga-Chanda approaches the outskirts both sides of Him are ornamented by Nityananda and Gadadhara. Following behind is the assembly of devotees, whose minds are all filled with bliss as they walk pleasantly. As Gauranga returns on the footpath to Navadvipa all the townspeople turn their heads to behold His enchanting beauty. His muscular, golden body is very tall and its sheer grace is like a lotus of pure desire in spotless waters. His knee-length arms sway back and forth as he walks. They appear as lotus-stems, or elephant trunks - they cannot be described",
  "His curling tresses are so lovely they mesmerize the entire universe and they are tied with the shyness of all the young girls. His wavy locks swing like a swarm of bumblebees and the chandan tilak upon His forehead diffuses rays just like a nectar-moon",
  "Fixing the flower-arrows of His restless eyes upon the bow of His eyebrows, He instantly pierces the hearts of the womenfolk by His mere glance. The smile on his moonlike face showers the rains of sweet ambrosia which makes the chnfcon-birds of the womens' hearts greedily fly after it. Jewelled makari-shaped earrings swing from his ears making the saphori-fish of the womens' hearts pursue and swallow them. The splendor of His neck and waist conquers that of the lion. These features of His vanquish the legend of the chaste girls' dharma. On His broad chest sway jewelled pearl necklaces and matchless Jasmine garlands. His limbs are nicely smeared with thick patches of Malayan sandahvood paste. His clothing and ornaments enrapture the entire universe. Description of the Town of Navadvipa",
  "Lord Gauranga now enters on the main road into Navadvipa and as the people hear of it, women, men, young and old all run to see Him. The sand on the road to Nadiya is white as a lotus flower and on both sides rise lofty palaces of pure white finish. Banners with golden lotus symbols are touching the sky as white, yellow and other colorful flags blow in the wind. The rooftop apartments are constructed with bewildering optical illusions and the gates to the houses are festooned with fluttering jasmine garlands. All the women who live along the road that Gauranga is traversing ascend their rooftops with great desire to behold Him. Does it appear that a garland of nectar-moons is rising in the sky with the clouds of their loosened hair flowing by their cheeks? Their jewelled necklaces appear like the rising stars and the waves of their smiles the striking of lightning",
  "Their soft chit-chatting is like the clouds' sweet gentle rumbling and their eyes the lotuses in the pond of affection. The handsome body of Gauranga is like a golden mountain peak upon which these girls shower the rains of loving attachment. From behind windows and portals some fix their eyes peering steadily down the path that Gauranga is travelling",
  "The town of Navadvipa extends for an area of four yojanas (32 square miles] . Here and there are flower gardens and heavenly lakes. All the palaces accomodate so many temples of numerous devatas above which are splendrous rows and rows of beautiful spires. There are four classes of people - the brahmanas, Kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras and their lovely homes shine in many orderly rows. Uncountable yogis, sannyasis, and brahmacharis live there. In some places there is recitation of the Bhagavad-Gita and the Puranas. In some places is the excitement of dancing, singing and playing on musical instruments. In some places small children loudly bicker and squabble. In some places uncountable children are playing. In some places numberless vipras study the scriptures In some places groups and groups of bhattacharyas congregate. Everyone walks along the roads of Nadiya. Three kinds of people travel on these roads - young, middle-aged and old and they all gaze incessantly upon the face of Gauranga and chant His Holy Name. Here and there are kadamba and bakula trees. All around their bases are supremely splendrous platforms. The town has marketplaces, vestibules and courtyards packed with dense crowds of celestial people. In the center of town are many, many mango trees among which are perpetually blossoming flower gardens. Surrounding the town are the flowing currents of the Sura-dhuni upon whose banks Gauranga sports enchanting pastimes",
  "The Glories of Navadvip",
  "(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat)",
  "There is no town like Navadvipa within the entire three worlds for it is where Guaranga Gosai has taken birth Understanding that Prabhu was going to appear there the Creator had made that place complete (sampurna).",
  "Oh friends ! Please listen to the meaning of the word 'sampurna' Everyone has not understood it, even after contemplating it. Great truth has been concentrated into very few letters. If one ponders it, then priceless jewels will be gained. Within the ocean are vast quantities of gemstones although the eyes can see nothing but water. Sinful blind persons have no eyes to see anything but water. Even if they hear of something else they do not believe it. Just as things within the ocean are not visible similarly the words of Vrindavan Dasa have a deeper purpose. No one can grasp the direct meaning of these statements - but only one whose heart is attached to Gauranga can understand. Some say that the word 'sampurna' indicates the fourteen worlds. Who can comprehend the sweetness of this direct meaning? It denotes the extent of all the pleasures in the universe Including beauty, majestic potency, and virtuous conduct, plus the intoxicating essence of the topmost limit of all knowledge, devotion, intelligence, wealth, mercy, glorious family dynasties and so on as well as perfectly complete proficiency in the abilities of relishment and mastery of all forms of craftsmanship - the word 'sampurna' is full of all these meanings. Now there is yet another nectarean thing to speak of. Hearing about it pleases one's ears and mind. The following words have issued forth from the mouth of the son of Narayani (Vrindavan Dasa Thakura):",
  "navadvipa je hena mathura raja-dhani",
  "This Navadvipa is just like the opulent capital city of Mathura",
  "Vrindavan Dasa is the object of Nityananda Prabhu's mercy, Who illumines him with the constant presence of His divine grace. One who thinks he can understand Vrindavan Dasa's statements is merely puffed-up with the illusory concept of scholarship and simply dies while engrossed in the false ego!",
  "(A song by Narahari Ghanashyama:)(refrain",
  "'Glories, glories to Shri Navadvipa, the abode of happiness! Peoples of the four ashrams dwell in wonderful homes, Where unparalleled festivals are observed according to custom.'",
  "It is the place where the eight mystic perfections and the nine opulences are the humble servant in every home Where those who are attached to dharma, artha, kama and moksha are merely ridiculed. Where the extremely severe threefold miseries are vanquished and the ninefold processes of bhakti shine continuously. Where the area is so full to overflowing with spotlessly pure prema that all the non-moving as well as the moving living beings remain everlastingly intoxicated in divine madness. Where the town is beautified by thousands of diverse residences and is encircled by the pure white waters of the Sura-dhuni where young kunda-jasmine blossoms and strands of fine pearls appear as if a host of full moons have simultaneously arisen Where the overall splendor is new and ever fresh just like Vrindavan and is served by six seasons that are succulent out to the horizon.",
  "Where the charming and grand glories are so expansive that Shesha Naga ever sings of them and never reaches their limit. The best of the demigods, four-faced Lord Brahma, in the company of the other devas, meditates on the exalted, limitless rasa manifest in this place. Ghanashyama narrates - may I eventually live in that place in the company of my Lord Gaurangaa and His associates.",
  "Gauranga Mahaprabhu Sits on the Bank of the Ganga",
  "Thus Lord Gauranga wanders about the town for a while then He proceeds on the path to the Sura-dhuni. Coming to the bank of the Ganga along with His associates. Gauranga Mahaprabhu, the moon over Nadiya sits down near a bathing landing. The bank of the Sura-dhuni shines with very beautiful meadows where so many shala, piyala and kadamba trees grow. There are peacocks, cuckoos and many bees flying amongst flower-fields in thick swarms. The bathing ghata is paved step by step in stone slabs with countless Shiva shrines on the upper level. Here and there are uncommon residential quarters in front of which flow the supremely pure waters. Sitting on this Ganga-ghata is Gauranga-Sundara. His form of Madana-Mohana is captivating to all. His charming face is continuously marked with smiles as He jokes and converses with His own associates. All the women who had come to get water from the river give up their shyness and gaze continuously upon the face of Gauranga. Some who were already carrying jugs full of water on top of their heads - as soon as they behold Gauranga, their hands slip from steadying their pots which fall and crash upon the ground. Here and there are thousands and thousands of vipras sitting in groups along with townswomen. Also uncountable bhattacharyas and their students are congregating and discussing the scriptures amongst themselves. What grand splendor is manifest on both sides of this Ganga ! Especially brilliant is the appearance of Gauranga-Chanda",
  "(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat)",
  "'Sitting on the bank is Shri Shachi-Nandana surrounded on four sides by His disciples It is just like Shri Nanda - Kumara Krishna on the bank of the Yamuna having fun amongst His cowherd boyfriends. Krishna-Chandra has now taken His cowherd boyfriends and sports numerous pranks in the form of a brahmana on the bank of the Ganga. Those people who happen to look upon Lord Gauranga's face there at the river obtain an absolutely indescribable type of happiness. Affected by Prabhu's extremely potent and masterful influence all the people on the bank of the Ganga warmly embrace each other. Glancing toward the teachers of the schools, Prabhu sits there and expounds His own commentaries Fortunate people watch as they surround Him on all sides, for by Lord Gauranga's power all of Navadvipa is free from miseries. Thus in the company of the devotees, Shri Shachi-Nandana offers obeisances to the Ganga and proceeds home. Prabhu travels on the main road into Nadiya during the time of the cows' return home. Herds and herds of cows are entering the town tended by hundreds and hundreds of cowherd boys. Many calves playfully follow behind with their tails raised aloft. Seeing this scene brings great delight to Prabhu's heart and with a choked voice He calls out the names of Krishna's cows, 0 white Dhavali !' and so on. Thousands upon thousands of vipras are coming on the path from the Ganga to perform their sandhya rituals at dusk. Numberless young brahmana boys also proceed toward their homes making a tumultuous commotion as they recite and hear scriptural verses. Lord Gauranga returns to His own home and sits down as His devotees all go and return to their own homes also. Then the bliss of Shachi Devi's heart swells up. As she sees the face of her dear son, her ocean of happiness overflows. Slowly and quietly she comes and sits before Gauranga. Overpowered with affection she wipes His limbs with her own cloth. It is just like mother Yashoda lovingly pampering Shri Krishna. Other than this comparison there is none within the three worlds.",
