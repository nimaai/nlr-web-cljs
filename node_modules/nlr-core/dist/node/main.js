He also dances wildly in a state of tearful shivering and over-whelming jubilation. After singing and dancing to His heart's content, He goes to a quiet flower-garden and enjoys a feast of forest fruits, served to Him as He reclines upon a jeweled bedstead. Thus, the Son of Shachi Devi is most deserving of my whole-hearted selfless worship.",

Just worship Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu who, at the end of the night, suddenly awakens upon hearing the sweet warbling of the birds within the delightfully flowering forest grove of Shrivasa Pandit! At this time, His whole body is intensely thrilled due to His being aware of Lord Krishna being situated very close to Shrimati Radhrarani on Their flower-bed in a bower-house in Vrindavan. Because of this Lord Gauranga's ecstatic love is expressed instantly by wonderfully transcendental symptoms such a fountains of tears gushing from His eyes, which bathe His entire body. Just worship this Lord Gauranga, Whose bodily complexion can only be compared to shimmering pure molten gold.",

While speaking He tastes with great relish the ecstatic mood of Radharani, which causes His entire body to fully blossom in transcendental jubilation. Dear mind, just perform your worship with boundless, unending pure love for this golden Lord Gauranga.",

During this period, all the residents of Vraja come out and become greatly anxious due to Krishnas departure from their midst. Lord Gauranga is so absorbed in this intense remembrance that He virtually becomes fused with the Vraja pastimes. Thus He imitates their statements and actions, also bestowing their mood amongst His Navadvipa devotees, who are in reality alternate manifestations of those self-same residents of Vraja.",

His whole body erupts in ecstatic bumps of sheer delight when He remembers the extensively variegated midday pastimes of Krishna sporting with Radha and the multitude of gopis. His voice stutters and chokes in excitement as He describes these lilas among His devotees, and thus He manifests the performance of plays and dramas which simultaneously correspond to the occurrence of the Divine Couple's pastimes.",

Remembering within the core of His heart, Lord Gauranga dances throughout the town of Navadvipa, spinning around while exhaling deeply ecstatic sighs. Thus becoming completely enchanted, He enchantes the townspeople so much that they all become helplessly stunned in divine love. Oh my dear mind, just worship this Shri Gauranga!",

His ecstatic singing is accompanied by the devotees who are expert in playing very loud rhytms on the mridanga drums. He wanders and dances with Shri Gadadhara Prabhu in the most astonishing way troughout the night, until just before dawn. Then He returns to His own home, where He retires to His bedchamber and falls asleep. I thus meditate on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga-nataraja.",

With His wife, Shri Vishnu-priya, He discusses many topics concerning the transcendental mellows of Their mutual loving affairs and thus They become very pleased. Then He gets up and goes to another room, wherein He sits upon a raised sitting place and is assisted by His devotees in washing His lotus face with nicely scented water. Thereafter, He very happily visits His mother, Shri Shachi Devi, as well as other friends and relatives in the home. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga-sundara.",

Returning to His home in order to perform opulent worship of Lord Vishnu, as well as other rituals, they later partake of the foodstuffs that were offered to Lord Vishnu. After washing His hand and mouth, Lord Gauranga goes into another room and rests very happily for awhile. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga-hari.",

Meeting with His devotees, Who are all very fond of chanting Shri Gaurahari-nama-kirtana, He personally tastes and relishes the chanting of the holy names. Thus He sports, sometimes in the way, He increases the ecstatic pleasure of all the townspeople so much that it attains limitless heights.

Afterwards,they all wander throughout the gardens and groves on the bank of the Ganga, where they enjoy the sweet cooling breezes blowing over the river. Hearing the pleasant sounds of the bumblebees and the birds in those gardens, the Lord remembers His ecstatic pastimes as Radha and Krishna, which are occurring simultaneously in His own forest of Vrindavana. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Lord Gauranga.",

In this mood, they leave the gardens and travel back toward His home. Along the way, He satisfies the eyes of all the townspeople, just as the moon satisfies the chakora bird with its moonbeams. Reaching home, Lord Gauranga is met at the door by His mother and lavished with loving attentions. I meditate on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga.",

Afterwards, the Lord puts on fresh silken clothes and is adorned with flower garlands. Then, He worships Lord Vishnu at home by performing the evening arati ceremony, offering ghee lamps and other items. Later, He and His friends partake of the foodstuffs and betel nuts that were offered to Lord Vishnu. I thus meditate on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga.",

Meeting with the multitude of His devotees, He tastes and relishes the nectar of topics about Lord Hari, and His mind becomes most agitated with the ecstasies of pure love of Godhead. Then, becoming very lustful to relish the congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord, Lord Gauranga orchestrates the performance of intensely jubilant sankirtana, which attains the summit of passionate glorification ,of these holy names. I thus meditate on the daily pastimes of Lord Gauranga-sundara."

		"Hearing this from the Lord , all the Vaishnavas were overjoyed and thus Gauranga Mahaprabhu began the grand sport of kirtan. This kirtan was held every night at Shrivasa's home and occasionally at Chandra-Shekhara's. Mukunda commenced with the auspicious invocation of the kirtan and then chanted 'Rama Krishna Narahari Gopala Govinda !' Everyone was there - Nityananda, Gadadhara, Advaita, Shrivasa, Vidya-Nidhi, Murari, Hiranya, Haridasa, Gangadasa Vanamali, Vijaya-Nandana, Jagadananda, Buddhimanta Khan, Narayana, Kashishvara, Vasudeva, Rama, Garuda, Govinda, Govindananda, Gopinatha, Jagadisha, Shriman, Shridhara, Sadashiva, Vakreshvara, Bhugarbha,Shuklambara, Brahmananda, Purushottama, Sanjaya, and so on -uncountable servants of Shri Gauranga were there - I know them all by name. All of them were present together during Lord Gauranga's dancing and other than His own personal associates, no one else was there.",
		"Hearing the loud shouting of Prabhu, mixed with the cries of 'Hari! Hari!' in the night - it was as if the universe was being split open. All the sinful souls were perishing in this tumult as Shachi-Nandana Gauranga ecstatically performed His kirtan. Seeing everyone forcefully tumbling and falling 'upon the ground, Govinda Dasa came forward and shut his eyes. Sometimes Gauranga manifested Himself in the mood of God and sometimes He would weep and exclaim, 'I am but a lowly servant!' Thus in the sacred courtyard of Shrivasa the auspicious uproar of ktrtan arose with the names 'Gopala ! Govinda !'",
		"The Ecstatic Chanting and Dancing Escalates",
		"Shrivasa took charge of one group as Mukunda took another and ran this way and that. Govinda Datta took charge of yet another and everyone did kirtan as Gauranga-Chandra danced. Sometimes the greatly muscular Nityananda would grab hold of Lord Gauranga, as Advaita secretly took the dust of His feet. Gadadhara and his group had tearful eyes and were completely overcome with bliss by Lord Gauranga's kirtan. When Prabhu Vishvambhara danced and stomped vigorously on the ground the earth trembled and everyone scattered in fear. Sometimes as Lord Gauranga Vishvambhara danced at a moderate pace, He appeared to be Lord Krishna Nanda-Nandana, the best of dancers. The next moment meditating inwardly, He would hold His bands as if He were playing a flute and thus looked exactly like Vrindavan-Chandra Himself. When He manifested this mood it was totally astonishing as the son of Jagannatha Mishra was suspended in the bliss of His own Holy Names.",
		"From moment-to-moment great perspiration would flow from His pores,appearing like the Ganga had personally come from His body. Seeing Lord Gauranga's ecstatic bliss, the Bhagavata devotees held each others' necks and wept. The divine limbs of everyone were smeared with divine chandan and they were adorrned with flower garlands. Ecstatically chanting Krishna's name they forgot all else in the world. The sounds of the mridangas, small finger-cymbals, and- conchshells mixed with the sankirtan in a thunderous blend of excitement. This tumult arose in the universe and filled the sky vanquishing inauspiciousness in all directions. What a wonder that upon the dancing of Whose servants all troubles were destroyed and the universe was made pure! Thus Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu personally danced to the chanting of His own holy names. What is the result of all this? These pastimes of Shri Gauranga were foretold in the ancient Puranas.",
		"In four directions resounded the most auspicious Shri Harinama Sankirtan and in the middle danced the son of Jagannatha Mishra. Absorbed in the bliss of Whose holy name, Lord Shiva does not know that he is naked, By Whose name Lord Brahma dances while He Himself also dances, By Whose name Valmiki became a great ascetic, By Whose name Ajamila was liberated, Whose name is taken by Shuka and Narada as they wander, Whose glories are sung by Shesha of a thousand mouths, in the bliss of His own names dances Prabhu Gauranga Vishvambhara. The rhythm of His feet striking the earth is most enchanting. Lord Gauranga looks at all the Vaishnavas one by one. Overcome with ecstatic moods, the devotees loudly repeat the names of the Lord's previous incarnations. Even Lord Haladhara, Shiva, Shuka, Narada, Prahlada, Lakshmi, Aja, nd Uddhava all chanted along with this kirtan of Lord Gauranga. As before, great care is taken that no outsiders enter the courtyard and behold this scene. Just as so many yugas elapsed during the performance of the maha-rasa dance - all the gopis in this present incarnation now consider such a length of time to pass like half a mustard-seed. In this way Krishna's inconceivable manifestation blossomed and only the fortunate servants of Shri Gauranga could come here.",
		"(There is a poem in this regard) 'Jaya re! Jaya re! Gauranga Shri Shachi-Nandana of lovely form dances auspiciously! His qualities are sung in ecstatic kirtan by Shrivasa, Ramananda, Mukunda and Vasu. The drums resound 'dram drimiki drimiki drimi' as the relishabIe finger-cymbals chime along sweetly. The hearts of his associates are pierced by flower-arrows, overwhelming them in ecstatic moods.'",

Radha and Krishna, the fresh young couple of Vrindavan have now appeared here as Gadadhara and Gauranga-Chandra. Radha Vrindavaneshvari is the personification of maha-bhava - She has now incarnated as Gadadhara Pandita.",
		"And Vrajendra-Nandana is the personification of the King of rasa - He has fully manifested as this Gauranga-Chandra. One who endeavors to worship on the raganuga-marga the path of spontaneous devotion follows the disciples of Pandita Gosai (Gadadhara Pandita). Without following them, Vraja cannot be attained. Therefore the Goswamis of Vraja are branches of this disciplic succession. He whom LakshmiDevi meditates upon, even executing austerities for the purpose of attaining Him, but still not attaining her desire - this Vrajendra-Nandana is truly loved by Radha.",
		"Indeed, She is overwhelmed with prema for Him at every moment nd now this Radha has become Gadadhara Panitta Gosai who is madly engrossed in the nectar-mellows of Gauranga-prema. Therefore one who is devoid of attachment to Gadadhara cannot attain prema-bhakti, but instead becomes totally destitute. If someone does not believe in this principle he cannot be delivered for a million births, and is completely ruined.",
		"My prayer at the feet of Gadadhara-Gauranga is that I have never had association with Your true followers. I have been pleased to associate with sinful atheists and I am pierced by the spears of Gadadhara Pandita's blasphemers. My mind is full of attachment to drinking liquor and I have frightfully kept the company of other drunkards. Still, perpetually hoping for the lotus feet of Gadadhara-Gauranga Lochana Dasa begs for shelter under these feet.",
		"(Another song by Lochana Dasa)",
		"Dear mind, just worship, just worship the son of Madhava known as Gadadhara! Whoever takes shelter of his lotus feet goes to Vraja-dhama. Previously he appeared in Vrishabhanu's house at Vraja-pura bearing the name Radhika. In the company of Her girlfriends, fond of playful pranks, She serves Shyama Krishna and makes Him happy. That form is now this form, the same Queen of relishable mellows. Just worship Her incessantly with single-minded attention. Now in the company of Gauranga , Radha has incarnated and sports playfully in the dress of a renounced male ascetic Gadadhara. Coming to Nilachala and living in the company of many devotees Gadadhara has delivered many countries. The entire universe is swimming in the flood of prema that he has brought , which vanquished all the miseries of everyone. But this sinful soul has never seen that cean of prema, says Lochana Dasa.",
		"(Another song by Lochana Dasa)",
		"In hope for Gadadhara, Gadadhara, Gadadhara - if you attain Gadadhara you get residence in Vraja-pura. Taking the name of Gadadhara I will become an ascetic. I will eat from my waterpot and wear a simple loincloth. These are the hopes of my mind for many days now. With my ears I will hear about Gadadhara-Gauranga-prema.Dear Lords! Only those who know You can be a guru or a disciple in Your lineage. Only persons bereft of eyes reject You and uselessly attempt to perform devotional service. One who is devoid of attachment to Gadadhara's lotus feet remains fallen in the ocean of birth and death.",
		"In hope of attaining the lotus feet of Gadadhara, Lochana Dasa begs for remembrance of those feet.",
		"(Another poem)",
		"Re! Some say that Gauranga is Janaki-vallabha (Lord Rama), the beloved of Radha, or Pancha Vana (Cupid with 5 flower arrows). But in the mind of the poet Nayanananda I know nothing other than this - that Gauranga is the life and soul of my Gadadhara . Re !' The Kirtan is Concluded. Thus Gauranga-Sundara frolics in the happiness of kirtana.",
		"As the late night enters the second prahara. After some time Lord Gauranga stops the chanting and sits in the courtyard with His devotees. His dear companions wave fans to alleviate the fatigue of the kirtana. Shachi Devi takes Lakshmi Vishnu-Priya along and quickly leaves for home. The other family members of the bhaktas also happily leave for their own residences. Arriving at home, Shachi Devi bids her daughter-in-law goodnight and goes inside feeling boundless bliss. Then Shachi begins to prepare edibles - and fixes her eyes on the path where Gauranga will appear. Gauranga bids farewell to all the devotees and proceeds toward His own home. On some nights after kirtan during the Summertime He bathes in the Ganga with the devotees in the moonlight. Arriving at home, servants wipe His body with fine damp cloths to relieve His fatigue from sporting so much chanting and dancing during the kirtan. Changing Him into fresh clothes they wash His sacred feet and He sits upon an asana to take prasad. Shachi Devi brings numerous offerings on golden trays and places them within the sight of her son. She comes over and sits before Him to behold His face and overflowing with pure loving affection, she eagerly urges Him to feast again and again.",
		"Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu eats while smiling gently as Lakshmi Vishnu-Priya looks on , filling her eyes. Finishing His meal Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu washes His mouth and sitting in a solitary place He chews betel nuts. Then He goes to His sleeping-chamber and lies down to rest upon the opulent bed. Whatever food remnants are leftover from Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu's plate are honored by Lakshmi Vishnu-Priya. All the servants headed by Ishana clean the house and go to take rest in their own quarters. Then Lakshmi Vishnu-Priya quickly goes to the Lord Gauranga's chamber and secretly serves his lotus feet.",
		"(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavata)",
		"After eating, Prabhu chews betel and goes to lie down, while Lakshmi takes His lotus feet.",
		"On some days the devotees headed by Haridasa and Gadadhara also rest in Lord Gauranga's house. Nityananda Prabhu comes here and takes his meal resting afterwards in great delight. Advaita , Shri Gadadhara , Vakreshvara, Shrivasa, Shri Narahari and all the other associates go to take rest in their own homes. Having their meals they then go to sleep.",
		"(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat)",
		"These pastimes we being performed by Gauranga Raya even up to the present moment. Occasionally some fortunate souls catch a glimpse of it. In the dead of night all becomes still as Gauranga-Sundara happily falls sleep. The servant of the servant of Shri Gauranga and Nityananda, Krishna Dasa narrates the Lord's pastimes.",

		"Within the temple, by the sleeping-chamber, is a flower -garden. Sitting upon branches here and there are cuckoos and other birds. The cool breeze flows with the pleasant fragrances of various flowers while the branches of the trees sway along ever so gently . Hanging upon the door of this inner chamber is the lovely sight of shoes ,umbrella and pure white chamara whisk. On both sides of the bed are golden tables supporting jeweled boxes containing betel-nut packets and golden pitchers full of scented water. On the floor in front of these tables is a beautiful place for rinsing the mouth.",
		"Lord Gauranga is Awakened",
		"Overcome with the fatigue of sporting vigorous kirtana the moonlike Gauranga-Shashi sleeps upon the bed. In the corner of the room sits a parrot in a golden cage. Seeing that the night has ended, the parrot becomes restless. With a blissful mind he thinks to himself, 'I will wake Gauranga' as his wings blossom with thrill-bumps and his eyes flow with tears.",
		"He calls out with a very sweet voice, 'Arise , Gauranga-Raya! The dew is settling upon the morning. Seeing the approaching pink of the rising sun, the bumblebees have abandoned their resting-place in the lotus flowers.'",
		"Seeing the directions illumined with glorious light the she-herons have arisen and playfully come to mingle with the he-herons. The swans and cranes and other water-dwelling birds have all gone to the bank of the celestial Sura-dhuni river (Ganga). All the birds headed by the doves have begun their cooing and chirping and the people stir about the town , seeing to their own work. The he-deer and she-deer have left their formation and wander in smaller groups for grazing on fresh grasses.",
		"His sleep broken upon hearing the words of the parrot. His two lotus eyes open ever so slightly. In His mind He is fully aware of the kunja-lila of Vrindavan and thus meditating on the dawn pastimes performed by Radha and Krishna in Their bowerhouse. He remains motionless and pretends to continue sleeping. In another room sleeps Shrimati Vishnu-Priya Devi who quickly gets out of her bed upon seeing the arrival of morning. She walks slowly in drowsiness and goes to Shachi's courtyard while her eyes roll to and fro.",
		"Hearing the sweet relishable sound of Vishnu-Priya's anklets and ornaments, Shachi opens the door and steps outside to greet her. Seeing her daughter-in-law, she speaks in pleasant words 'I am busy with household chores now. You may go and bathe in the Sura-dhuni.' Then, in order to pamper her son, Shachi proceeds very quickly with anxious mind.",
		"Entering His sleeping-chamber, she silently comes before His bed. Stroking His divine form very. very tenderly with her hand he considerately speaks in a soft and gentle voice, 'Arise, dear son Gauranga-Chanda, it is morning. The townspeople have arisen and are sitting in anticipation. Shrivasa and all the other devotees are very anxiously waiting to see you. Please get up and quickly start on the path Give up your sleep, arise and go wash your face.'",
		"The Lord Begins His Day Hearing His mother's words, Gauranga-Raya stretches His body and sits up in the bed. At this moment , Sita Thakurani (the wife of Shri Advaita) arrives along with Malini (the wife of Shrivasa Pandita) and other chaste wives of the devotees. Having all come and met together at Shachi's home they enter Gauranga's sleeping chamber. All the ladies of the town also proceed there with anxious minds just to have darshan of Gauranga. Mother Shachi lights a ghee-lamp scented with camphor on a golden tray, then jubilantly places it in the hands of Malini (wife of Shrivasa Thakura), who offers it as arati to the gorgeous Gauranga-Sundara.",
		"The male servants attentively bring in a golden footstool, full water pitchers, a tongue scraper, tooth powder, and so forth. Leaving the room, Gauranga comes out into the courtyard. Going to another room in the house, He conducts His morning activities. Then He comes out and sits down with His foot upon a footstool. After brushing His teeth and other duties, He goes and sits on a very elevated sitting place. Then His devotees, who have also just finished their morning practices, begin to arrive - Prabhu Nityananda, Shri Advaita, Gadadhara, Mukunda, Murari, Haridasa, Vakreshvara, Shuklambara Brahmachari, Shridhara and others.",

It cannot even be described with words! Description of Shrimati Vishnu-Priya's Beauty Then Vishnu-Priya Devi very playfully goes in the company of her girlfriends to bathe in the Sura-dhuni river. The complexion of her body conquers that of a golden lotus and her most lovely face radiates the splendor of how many moons? Her braid graces her hips like a great snake and it is bound with golden threads interwoven with strands of bakula flowers. Her wavy locks appear to be swarms of bumblebees and her two cheeks sparkle like mirrors.Her ears are adorned with jewel-studded earrings swinging from which are tiny ornaments inlaid with pearls.",
		"To support the weight of this extraordinary ear-ornament a golden chain, is fastened to a post in her earlobe and loops over her ear. The part in her hair is bordered by tiny pearls tied on golden threads and interspersed with rubies. On her forehead is a dot of sindura tinted reddish like the rising sun both sides of which are embellished with designs drawn in dark musk. Further designs in musk beautify her cheeks and her pleasingly-colored lips form an enchantingly gentle smile. Her fickle eyes dart about like the movements of a wagtail bird as Cupid himself trembles in fear to see the movements of her eyebrows.",
		"Her nose conquers the beauty of the sesame flower and an elephant-pearl swings from it. Around her neck is an ornamental necklace interwoven with jasmine garlands From her neck descends a splendrous array of golden necklaces, arranged in successive loops from small to large. The beauty of her breasts puts to shame that of golden waterpitchers and they are encircled with champaka flowerbuds. Her breasts are adorned with vines drawn in sandalwood paste and bordered with strands of precious elephant-pearls. Her two arms appear as golden lotus-stems and they are decorated with conchshell-bangles and other ornaments. Her upper arms are encircled by armlets that are bordered with silk dangling from which, are golden charms. From her reddish palms extend fingers adorned with rings and her index finger shines with a golden ornament that is studded with mirrors. Her entire form is made lustrous y her divine raincloud-colored silken cloth its border studded with sparkling jewels and precious jari weavings.",
		"Her hips are broad and her waist is slim. Orchid-jewels playfully dance upon her ornamental belt. Her feet are decorated with reddish lac-dye and her anklebells are trimmed with Jewels Her sweet gait mocks that of a royal swan as her anklets resound like the chirping of sparrows. Her entire body ridicules the softness of fresh cream. Amidst jokes and laughter she bathes in the Sura-dhuni.",

Then Shachi Devi comes into the kitchen and is overjoyed to view the assortment of cooked preparations. She addresses her daughter-in-law. 'What is the delay with the cooking?' Vishnu-Priya is embarrassed and does not say a word in reply. So Malini speaks up. 'Oh Shachi Devi ! The cooking is finished. There is no more delay.' Shachi says, 'Good!

All the devotees headed by Nityananda Prabhu , Advaita Gosai, Narahari, Gadadhara, Shrivasa, Ramai, Vakreshvara, Haridasa and others had returned to their own homes after bathing in the Ganga.

Washing His mouth, He goes and sits on an asana as all the devotees sit surrounding Him on all sides. Prabhu eats betel nuts and laughs, while some attendants serve Him by waving chamara whisks. Then Sita Devi takes Malini and the devotees' wives. Shachi comes forward and seats them all, feeding them to the great delight of her heart.

They wash their mouths and go to sit in a solitary place, as the servants headed by Ishana come for their own meal. The servants then clean the house.

The bank of the Sura-dhuni is lined with rows of kadamba trees. There are thousands and thousands of peacocks, cuckoos and bees buzzing. The Lord's mind is overwhelmed with the remembrance of the Yamuna river and He has a vision of Krishna herding cows in the pastures. Thus He calls out with great feeling, O Shridama ! Sudama !

Seeing this thorny forest from afar, the common people never come her. Madhavi and malati jasmine-vines climb up and embrace the kadamba trees. The pleasant south wind blows, carrying flower-pollen with its breezes. In four directions are four paths formed with jewels. In two directions are beautiful rows of bakula trees. The forest blooms with small white kunda-jasmine buds, splender, red amaranth, tagara flower-trees, groups of jewelled gardens, nageshvara flowers, and many other varieties of fragrant jasmines like jati, yuthi and mallika.

The East courtyard has groves of divine Tulasi plants. The West courtyard has groves of colorful flame-trees. The North and South have grasses of dark Syamala color which bring to mind soft pillows to sit on.

		"Oh friends ! Please listen to the meaning of the word 'sampurna' Everyone has not understood it, even after contemplating it. Great truth has been concentrated into very few letters. If one ponders it, then priceless jewels will be gained. Within the ocean are vast quantities of gemstones although the eyes can see nothing but water. Sinful blind persons have no eyes to see anything but water. Even if they hear of something else they do not believe it. Just as things within the ocean are not visible similarly the words of Vrindavan Dasa have a deeper purpose. No one can grasp the direct meaning of these statements - but only one whose heart is attached to Gauranga can understand. Some say that the word 'sampurna' indicates the fourteen worlds. Who can comprehend the sweetness of this direct meaning? It denotes the extent of all the pleasures in the universe Including beauty, majestic potency, and virtuous conduct, plus the intoxicating essence of the topmost limit of all knowledge, devotion, intelligence, wealth, mercy, glorious family dynasties and so on as well as perfectly complete proficiency in the abilities of relishment and mastery of all forms of craftsmanship - the word 'sampurna' is full of all these meanings. Now there is yet another nectarean thing to speak of. Hearing about it pleases one's ears and mind. The following words have issued forth from the mouth of the son of Narayani (Vrindavan Dasa Thakura):",
		"navadvipa je hena mathura raja-dhani",

One who thinks he can understand Vrindavan Dasa's statements is merely puffed-up with the illusory concept of scholarship and simply dies while engrossed in the false ego!",
		"(A song by Narahari Ghanashyama:)(refrain",
		"'Glories, glories to Shri Navadvipa, the abode of happiness! Peoples of the four ashrams dwell in wonderful homes, Where unparalleled festivals are observed according to custom.'",
		"It is the place where the eight mystic perfections and the nine opulences are the humble servant in every home Where those who are attached to dharma, artha, kama and moksha are merely ridiculed. Where the extremely severe threefold miseries are vanquished and the ninefold processes of bhakti shine continuously. Where the area is so full to overflowing with spotlessly pure prema that all the non-moving as well as the moving living beings remain everlastingly intoxicated in divine madness. Where the town is beautified by thousands of diverse residences and is encircled by the pure white waters of the Sura-dhuni where young kunda-jasmine blossoms and strands of fine pearls appear as if a host of full moons have simultaneously arisen Where the overall splendor is new and ever fresh just like Vrindavan and is served by six seasons that are succulent out to the horizon.",
		"Where the charming and grand glories are so expansive that Shesha Naga ever sings of them and never reaches their limit. The best of the demigods, four-faced Lord Brahma, in the company of the other devas, meditates on the exalted, limitless rasa manifest in this place. Ghanashyama narrates - may I eventually live in that place in the company of my Lord Gaurangaa and His associates.",
		"Gauranga Mahaprabhu Sits on the Bank of the Ganga",
		"Thus Lord Gauranga wanders about the town for a while then He proceeds on the path to the Sura-dhuni. Coming to the bank of the Ganga along with His associates. Gauranga Mahaprabhu, the moon over Nadiya sits down near a bathing landing. The bank of the Sura-dhuni shines with very beautiful meadows where so many shala, piyala and kadamba trees grow. There are peacocks, cuckoos and many bees flying amongst flower-fields in thick swarms. The bathing ghata is paved step by step in stone slabs with countless Shiva shrines on the upper level. Here and there are uncommon residential quarters in front of which flow the supremely pure waters. Sitting on this Ganga-ghata is Gauranga-Sundara. His form of Madana-Mohana is captivating to all. His charming face is continuously marked with smiles as He jokes and converses with His own associates. All the women who had come to get water from the river give up their shyness and gaze continuously upon the face of Gauranga. Some who were already carrying jugs full of water on top of their heads - as soon as they behold Gauranga, their hands slip from steadying their pots which fall and crash upon the ground. Here and there are thousands and thousands of vipras sitting in groups along with townswomen. Also uncountable bhattacharyas and their students are congregating and discussing the scriptures amongst themselves. What grand splendor is manifest on both sides of this Ganga ! Especially brilliant is the appearance of Gauranga-Chanda",
		"(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat)",
		"'Sitting on the bank is Shri Shachi-Nandana surrounded on four sides by His disciples It is just like Shri Nanda - Kumara Krishna on the bank of the Yamuna having fun amongst His cowherd boyfriends. Krishna-Chandra has now taken His cowherd boyfriends and sports numerous pranks in the form of a brahmana on the bank of the Ganga. Those people who happen to look upon Lord Gauranga's face there at the river obtain an absolutely indescribable type of happiness. Affected by Prabhu's extremely potent and masterful influence all the people on the bank of the Ganga warmly embrace each other. Glancing toward the teachers of the schools, Prabhu sits there and expounds His own commentaries Fortunate people watch as they surround Him on all sides, for by Lord Gauranga's power all of Navadvipa is free from miseries. Thus in the company of the devotees, Shri Shachi-Nandana offers obeisances to the Ganga and proceeds home. Prabhu travels on the main road into Nadiya during the time of the cows' return home. Herds and herds of cows are entering the town tended by hundreds and hundreds of cowherd boys. Many calves playfully follow behind with their tails raised aloft. Seeing this scene brings great delight to Prabhu's heart and with a choked voice He calls out the names of Krishna's cows, 0 white Dhavali !' and so on. Thousands upon thousands of vipras are coming on the path from the Ganga to perform their sandhya rituals at dusk. Numberless young brahmana boys also proceed toward their homes making a tumultuous commotion as they recite and hear scriptural verses. Lord Gauranga returns to His own home and sits down as His devotees all go and return to their own homes also. Then the bliss of Shachi Devi's heart swells up. As she sees the face of her dear son, her ocean of happiness overflows. Slowly and quietly she comes and sits before Gauranga. Overpowered with affection she wipes His limbs with her own cloth. It is just like mother Yashoda lovingly pampering Shri Krishna. Other than this comparison there is none within the three worlds.",

On Shachi's order, Devi Vishnu-Priya lights a lamp and goes into the temple. On the altar is a murti of Raghunatha in the form of a rock (shila). Prabhu performs the arati and bows down to offer obeisances . He brings and offers many gifts to the deity. Giving the image achaman He then puts Him to rest. Gauranga comes out of the temple and sits upon a divine lion-throne as Shachi's bliss knows no bounds.

Travelling on the path like a maddened lion. Lord Gauranga eventually arrives at Shrivasa's residence. Seeing Prabhu come in, Shrivasa becomes very Jubilant and a great ecstasy blossoms among he and his family members. Bowing at His feet they wash them, then take and seat Him upon a divine lion-throne",
