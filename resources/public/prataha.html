While speaking He tastes with great relish the ecstatic mood of Radharani, which causes His entire body to fully blossom in transcendental jubilation. Dear mind, just perform your worship with boundless, unending pure love for this golden Lord Gauranga.</p>

        <p id="vishvanath-description" class="lead">In the morning, after sunrise, Lord Gauranga goes with His associates to bathe in the holy river. While bathing, they also worship Mother Ganga by offering flowers, incense and other presentations. They then come onto the bank of the river, where He is dressed with exquisite cloth and decorated with fresh flower garlands, sandalwood paste and other ornaments. Returning to His home in order to perform opulent worship of Lord Vishnu, as well as other rituals, they later partake of the foodstuffs that were offered to Lord Vishnu. After washing His hand and mouth, Lord Gauranga goes into another room and rests very happily for awhile. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga-hari.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Dive deeper...</h2>
        <p id="long-description" class="lead">Waking up in the morning Lord Gauranga sits in the courtyard surrounded by His intimate associates. Effortlessly enchanting the minds of all beings in the universe He penetrates into their hearts and remains there always. After brushing His teeth and so forth He bathes in the celestial river Ganga overcome with ecstatic bliss . Then back at His home, He takes breakfast with His associates sporting novel prankish fun and afterwards rests. The Cooking Begins Returning home, Vishnu-Priya changes her clothes and begins arranging the paraphernalia for Vishnu-puja. Shachi Thakurani quickly completes her own bath and seeing that it is late, goes home as fast as possible. Then Sita Devi, Malini and the wives of all the dear devotees also finish their baths and proceed at once to Shachi&#x27;s home. Going inside, they carefully receive the finest items to offer the Lord that are brought from their homes by maidservants. Shachi Mata takes the items along and washing her feet enters the kitchen. Approaching Vishnu-Priya Devi, Shachi says &#x27;It is so late! Alas! Please begin cooking!&#x27; Very happy in her mind to receive this order, Vishnu-Priya immediately goes and sits down to cook. All the cooking duties performed by Malini are directed by the gestures of Sita Thakurani. First they cook sweet rice. Upon its completion it is transferred to a new container. Numerous types of spinach are prepared then arum-root, eggplant and many other items. Assorted vegetables are minced and spiced with black pepper. Pea soup is made with dried mango pieces. Many varieties of curries soaked in ghee are kept separately. Ground kidney-bean patties and ground pea patties are nicely fried in ghee. Coconut-cereal is fried along with cakes made from flowers. There are different kinds of eggplant mixed with sesame seeds. Much effort and attention is given in all this cooking. The sweet and the sour preparations are kept separately. Ground kidney-bean patties are soaked in sour yogurt then mixed with cumin and black pepper and are fried. They make varieties of sweet pies with farina sprinkling them with ghee which they carefully store. Milk-film is stuffed with creamy curd, sugar and spices, and is fried. They make so many items that it is impossible to describe them all. A great quantity of the finest rice is nicely cleaned and cooked in limitless different styles. In another house someone chums milk, while elsewhere others prepare sweetmeats and cooked vegetables. Farina is kneaded with sugar and carefully rolled into laddus. Wheat is formed into coils, fried in ghee and soaked in sweet juice. Cheese and condensed milk is kneaded with sugar and formed into laddus shaped like pomegranates. They make sweets from pumpkin and also disc-shaped crispy cakes. Large quantities of cucumber and chick-peas are fried in ghee. Milk is cooked down until it forms very thick kshira, then it is poured into new clay pots; cardamon , camphor, black pepper and so forth are added and it is immediately put away to cool. Some squash are cooked in milk , others in yogurt. Ghee without salt is used to fry celestial spinach. Delicious ginger-curd sweets are prepared from sesame powder. They are sprinkled with ghee and placed to soak in clay pans of yogurt. Magnolia and banana sweets are made with thickly condensed milk. Numerous varieties of out-of-season fruits are somehow produced. Sherbets are made from pomegranate, lotus flowers and sugarcane. On top of these are placed coconut pieces carved in different shapes. Oranges, almonds, mashed date-balls, lemons, grapes and custard-apples are mixed with profuse quantities of cream. Cereals are meticulously prepared from pigeon-peas and chick-peas. the night before they had been ground and soaked in water. Salt is crushed and kept separately. Numerous kinds of pickles are brought to the house from elsewhere. Ripe mango pieces are marinated in sugar-sauce. Shachi has been keeping them soaking for many days. There are mustard-powder soup, plum pickles and many more things that are brought and placed outside. Then Shachi Devi comes into the kitchen and is overjoyed to view the assortment of cooked preparations. She addresses her daughter-in-law. &#x27;What is the delay with the cooking?&#x27; Vishnu-Priya is embarrassed and does not say a word in reply. So Malini speaks up. &#x27;Oh Shachi Devi ! The cooking is finished. There is no more delay.&#x27; Shachi says, &#x27;Good! I have personally cleaned Lord Vishnu&#x27;s eating-room with my own hands. Now I am quickly going to arrange the offering there.&#x27; Saying this, she goes outside and says to Ishana. &#x27;Please ask Vishvambhara to immediately take His bath in the Ganga. It is upsetting my mind that we are so late today - the rice and cooked vegetables are getting cold!&#x27; Gauranga Mahaprabhu Goes to Bathe in the Ganga Ishana goes and addresses the Lord. &#x27;Mata has asked me to tell you to go bathe in the Ganga now.&#x27; Hearing this, Gauranga Mahaprabhu feels very blissful in His mind and leaves with His devotees for bathing The devotees gather flower garlands, ground sandalwood pulp, scented oil for massaging His body and clean clothes as they depart for the river. Along the way , He has many conversations with the devotees. Then, in their company Shri Gauranga Raya enters the waters of the Ganga and offers His obeisances unto her. (From the Chaitanya Bhagavat) &#x27;Who could possibly describe the opulence of Nadiya? At one bathing place, thousands and thousands of people bathe Some are peaceful saints, some austere ascetics, some sannyasis I don&#x27;t know how many children come there and mix in the crowds! The Jahnavi (Ganga) encircles the Lord on all sides and He secretly offers her own water unto her ripples On the plea of making waves, the Jahnavi dances even though her feet are served by residents of limitless universes. Navadvipa Raya played water-sports in the Ganga river while the residents of Nadiya looked on in the greatest fortune. As Prabhu Vishvambhara played in the waters of the Ganga He looked just like the full moon itself playing in the ocean All the fortunate souls who had come to the landing to bathe incessantly beheld the face of Vishvambhar. &#x27; One male servant (dasa) comes forward to massage the Lord attentively rubbing and cleansing His body. Then Prabhu bathes in the company of His devotees and they ascend the riverbank with much playful sporting. Another dasa comes forward to wipe His body dry carefully disentangling and dressing His hair. Helping Him change into dry clothes he adorns Him with divine flower garlands, sandalwood paste and ornaments for each and every limb. The Offering On returning home, Prabhu Gauranga Shri Hari washes His feet and enters the temple room of Lord Vishnu ( From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat:) Gauranga Bhagavan properly performs Vishnu-puja. Offering water with Tulasi , He then offers obeisances. Then Prabhu comes and sits upon a golden platform and offers the sweetmeats to Lord Vishnu. Shachi Devi carefully brings the items on golden plates and places them before her son. Offering scented water from a golden vessel, He sits alone and feeds the Lord some nice edibles. All the devotees headed by Nityananda Prabhu , Advaita Gosai, Narahari, Gadadhara, Shrivasa, Ramai, Vakreshvara, Haridasa and others had returned to their own homes after bathing in the Ganga. Each performing their own morning duties they again come together to meet at Prabhu&#x27;s house. Then Vishnu-Priya Devi finishes her cooking. On Shachi&#x27;s order she goes to the offering-room and places various types of rice on many golden plates; lining them up in mound after mound, she sprinkles them with ghee. All the vegetable preparations that were cooked are plied alongside the rice in successive order. All the cooked grains as well as all the pickled items are arranged in row after row according to the progression of their taste. Water is poured into a golden vessel and is scented with camphor. The finest betel nuts are made pleasant by adding cloves and cardamon and are put into a bejewelled box. Placing Tulasi-manjaris upon the grains she offers the food to the Shaligram while giving Him achamana. The Morning meal Then Shachi Devi very jubilantly calls her son and His friends to eat. Nityananda accompanies the Lord and His devotees as they quickly come, Gauranga-Chandra washes His feet and sits upon a majestic seat Nityananda and Gadadhara sit on either side of Him, while Advaita and Shrivasa sit facing them. All the devotees sit in the courtyard while Shachi blissfully serves them. Again and again she brings and serves all the cooked offerings. Overwhelmed with affection she makes them eat while all their chaste wives stand and watch from afar. Lord Gauranga laughs and jokes while He eats as the male servants bring and serve water. Washing His mouth, He goes and sits on an asana as all the devotees sit surrounding Him on all sides. Prabhu eats betel nuts and laughs, while some attendants serve Him by waving chamara whisks. Then Sita Devi takes Malini and the devotees&#x27; wives. Shachi comes forward and seats them all, feeding them to the great delight of her heart. After eating the wives return to their own homes and Shachi finally eats along with Vishnu-Priya. They wash their mouths and go to sit in a solitary place, as the servants headed by Ishana come for their own meal. The servants then clean the house. After washing all the pots and plates they put them away. Nityananda and the other devotees go to take a little rest. Seeing His devotees off , Prabhu Vishvambhara enters the sleeping chamber. Lying on His bed He goes to sleep while some dear one massages His feet. A few devotees headed by Gadadhara and Narahari also rest along with the Lord In His house. The servant of the servant of Shri Gauranga and Nityananda, Krishna Dasa narrates the Lord&#x27;s pastimes. Thus Ends the Pratah-Lila.</p>
