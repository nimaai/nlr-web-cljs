        <p id="vishvanath-description" class="lead">At dusk, the Lord bathes with His dear friends in the Ganga, the river who flows in the three parts. They devoutly worship the Ganga by offering ghee lamps, flowers, and other articles. Afterwards, the Lord puts on fresh silken clothes and is adorned with flower garlands. Then, He worships Lord Vishnu at home by performing the evening arati ceremony, offering ghee lamps and other items. Later, He and His friends partake of the foodstuffs and betel nuts that were offered to Lord Vishnu. I thus meditate on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga.</p>

        <p id="long-description" class="lead">At dusk , He returns to His own home in the most astonishing manner and endeavors carefully to worship the deity which pleases His mother very much Gauranga is Bathed and Then Worships the Deity Then all the male-servants act very quickly filling golden pitchers with water and bringing them in. One washes the Lord&#x27;s feet. One combs out His hair and ties it in a topknot. His body is cleansed with scented water. Finally rinsing Him again, they cover Him with fine white cloth and offer Him fresh clothing and ornaments. Gaurahari then enters the temple of Lord Vishnu. On Shachi&#x27;s order, Devi Vishnu-Priya lights a lamp and goes into the temple. On the altar is a murti of Raghunatha in the form of a rock (shila). Prabhu performs the arati and bows down to offer obeisances . He brings and offers many gifts to the deity. Giving the image achaman He then puts Him to rest. Gauranga comes out of the temple and sits upon a divine lion-throne as Shachi&#x27;s bliss knows no bounds. All the offerings that were presented to the deity in the Vishnu temple are saved separately for the evening. Some items are brought out and placed before Shachi&#x27;s son and Lord Gauranga smilingly eats in the greatest happiness. After washing His mouth. Gauranga Raya sits down again as Vishnu-Priya Devi remains nearby to offer Him betel. (From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat) Knowing the intense bliss of His mother&#x27;s heart Lord Gauranga stays there and sits with Lakshmi. Lord Guaranga Proceeds to Shrivasa&#x27;s House Then suddenly Lord Gauranga becomes obsessed in his mind and He departs for Shrivasa&#x27;s house. What splendor is seen during this dusk time ! In the four directions is a great tumult of singing and music. Brilliant lamps are lit by the streets in row after row making all the town spotlessly pure by their effulgence. Travelling on the path like a maddened lion. Lord Gauranga eventually arrives at Shrivasa&#x27;s residence. Seeing Prabhu come in, Shrivasa becomes very Jubilant and a great ecstasy blossoms among he and his family members. Bowing at His feet they wash them, then take and seat Him upon a divine lion-throne The servant of the servant of Shri Gauranga and Nityananda Krishna Dasa narrates the Lord&#x27;s pastimes. Thus Ends the Sayan-Lila</p>
